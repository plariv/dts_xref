          <p>We are all familiar with the naturalistic fallacy-concluding that because something is, it also should be. This article responds to a related fallacy that operates in our thinking about educational standards. This might be called the idealistic fallacy-the idea that because something is valued, it can be mandated. We ask if the recently developed Next Generation Science Standards are well enough aligned with the current reality-how actual students understand science concepts-to avoid the idealistic fallacy. The authors of the Next Generation Science Standards point out that, &quot;The framework and subsequent standards will not lead to improvements in K-12 science education unless other components of the system-curriculum, instruction, professional development, and assessment-change so that they are aligned with the framework's vision.&quot; We agree. However, we also argue that the Standards themselves should be informed by strong empirical evidence about the development of STEM skills and concepts. We propose a much-needed developmental taxonomy of STEM learning that could inform the science standards and help educators achieve them.</p></td>

          <p>With the advent of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), students will increasingly be expected to achieve certain levels of skill and knowledge in key content areas. For example, the NGSS suggest that by the end of high school, students should have a sophisticated understanding of evidence and inquiry. In this article, we will describe the research behind a set of learning sequences for conceptions of evidence and inquiry (covering grades 3-13), then examine how understanding of these constructs-in a diverse sample of over 4000 students in grades 4-13-aligns with requirements in the Next Generation Science Standards. We will show that even in the best schools, only a small percentage of students in each grade demonstrated the mandated level of comprehension. Findings point to several pressing needs, including the need for: <br />
            · developmental taxonomies of learning that can inform standards, curricula, and assessments; <br />
            · a close examination of curricular assumptions, particularly as students enter college or university; <br />
            · diagnostic assessments, that can be used to identify students' specific learning needs; and <br />
            · curricula that are customized for the learning needs of individual students-delivering the right learning experiences to individual students at the optimal moment.</p></td>
