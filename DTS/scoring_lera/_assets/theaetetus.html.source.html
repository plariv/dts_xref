<a name="l134"><span class="linenum"> 134</span></a>  <span class="comment">1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any &quot;box model math&quot;. Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.</span>

<a name="l136"><span class="linenum"> 136</span></a>  <span class="comment">2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a &quot;display:inline&quot; declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.</span>

<a name="l138"><span class="linenum"> 138</span></a>  <span class="comment">3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.</span>

<a name="l140"><span class="linenum"> 140</span></a>  <span class="comment">4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.</span>

<a name="l445"><span class="linenum"> 445</span></a>        enter the house, and the dialogue is read to them by a servant.    &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l446"><span class="linenum"> 446</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid&lt;/em&gt;. Have you only just arrived from the country, Terpsion?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l447"><span class="linenum"> 447</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;Terpsion. No, I came some time ago: and I have been in the Agora looking
<a name="l448"><span class="linenum"> 448</span></a>        for you, and wondering that I could not find you. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l449"><span class="linenum"> 449</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid.&lt;/em&gt; But I was not in the city. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l450"><span class="linenum"> 450</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; Where then? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l451"><span class="linenum"> 451</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid.&lt;/em&gt; As I was going down to the harbour, I met Theaetetus-he was being
<a name="l452"><span class="linenum"> 452</span></a>        carried up to Athens from the army at Corinth. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l453"><span class="linenum"> 453</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; Was he alive or dead? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l454"><span class="linenum"> 454</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid.&lt;/em&gt; He was scarcely alive, for he has been badly wounded; but he
<a name="l455"><span class="linenum"> 455</span></a>        was suffering even more from the sickness which has broken out in
<a name="l456"><span class="linenum"> 456</span></a>        the army. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l457"><span class="linenum"> 457</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; The dysentery, you mean? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l458"><span class="linenum"> 458</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l459"><span class="linenum"> 459</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; Alas! what a loss he will be! &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l460"><span class="linenum"> 460</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, Terpsion, he is a noble fellow; only to-day I heard some
<a name="l461"><span class="linenum"> 461</span></a>        people highly praising his behaviour in this very battle.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l462"><span class="linenum"> 462</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; No wonder; I should rather be surprised at hearing anything
<a name="l463"><span class="linenum"> 463</span></a>        else of him. But why did he go on, instead of stopping at Megara?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l464"><span class="linenum"> 464</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid.&lt;/em&gt; He wanted to get home: although I entreated and advised him to
<a name="l465"><span class="linenum"> 465</span></a>        remain he would not listen to me; so I set him on his way, and turned
<a name="l466"><span class="linenum"> 466</span></a>        back, and then I remembered what Socrates had said of him, and thought
<a name="l467"><span class="linenum"> 467</span></a>        how remarkably this, like all his predictions, had been fulfilled.
<a name="l468"><span class="linenum"> 468</span></a>        I believe that he had seen him a little before his own death, when
<a name="l469"><span class="linenum"> 469</span></a>        Theaetetus was a youth, and he had a memorable conversation with him,
<a name="l470"><span class="linenum"> 470</span></a>        which he repeated to me when I came to Athens; he was full of admiration
<a name="l471"><span class="linenum"> 471</span></a>        of his genius, and said that he would most certainly be a great man,
<a name="l472"><span class="linenum"> 472</span></a>        if he lived. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l473"><span class="linenum"> 473</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; The prophecy has certainly been fulfilled; but what was the
<a name="l474"><span class="linenum"> 474</span></a>        conversation? can you tell me? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l475"><span class="linenum"> 475</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid.&lt;/em&gt; No, indeed, not offhand; but I took notes of it as soon as I
<a name="l476"><span class="linenum"> 476</span></a>        got home; these I filled up from memory, writing them out at leisure;
<a name="l477"><span class="linenum"> 477</span></a>        and whenever I went to Athens, I asked Socrates about any point which
<a name="l478"><span class="linenum"> 478</span></a>        I had forgotten, and on my return I made corrections; thus I have
<a name="l479"><span class="linenum"> 479</span></a>        nearly the whole conversation written down. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l480"><span class="linenum"> 480</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; I remember-you told me; and I have always been intending to
<a name="l481"><span class="linenum"> 481</span></a>        ask you to show me the writing, but have put off doing so; and now,
<a name="l482"><span class="linenum"> 482</span></a>        why should we not read it through?-having just come from the country,
<a name="l483"><span class="linenum"> 483</span></a>        I should greatly like to rest. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l484"><span class="linenum"> 484</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid.&lt;/em&gt; I too shall be very glad of a rest, for I went with Theaetetus
<a name="l485"><span class="linenum"> 485</span></a>        as far as Erineum. Let us go in, then, and, while we are reposing,
<a name="l486"><span class="linenum"> 486</span></a>        the servant shall read to us. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l487"><span class="linenum"> 487</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; Very good. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l488"><span class="linenum"> 488</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid&lt;/em&gt;. Here is the roll, Terpsion; I may observe that I have introduced
<a name="l489"><span class="linenum"> 489</span></a>        Socrates, not as narrating to me, but as actually conversing with
<a name="l490"><span class="linenum"> 490</span></a>        the persons whom he mentioned-these were, Theodorus the geometrician
<a name="l491"><span class="linenum"> 491</span></a>        (of Cyrene), and Theaetetus. I have omitted, for the sake of convenience,
<a name="l492"><span class="linenum"> 492</span></a>        the interlocutory words &amp;quot;I said,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I remarked,&amp;quot; which he used when
<a name="l493"><span class="linenum"> 493</span></a>        he spoke of himself, and again, &amp;quot;he agreed,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;disagreed,&amp;quot; in the
<a name="l494"><span class="linenum"> 494</span></a>        answer, lest the repetition of them should be troublesome.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l495"><span class="linenum"> 495</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terp.&lt;/em&gt; Quite right, Euclid. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l496"><span class="linenum"> 496</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid&lt;/em&gt;. And now, boy, you may take the roll and read. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l497"><span class="linenum"> 497</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Euclid&lt;/em&gt;'s servant reads. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l498"><span class="linenum"> 498</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; If I cared enough about the Cyrenians, Theodorus, I would
<a name="l499"><span class="linenum"> 499</span></a>        ask you whether there are any rising geometricians or philosophers
<a name="l500"><span class="linenum"> 500</span></a>        in that part of the world. But I am more interested in our own Athenian
<a name="l501"><span class="linenum"> 501</span></a>        youth, and I would rather know who among them are likely to do well.
<a name="l502"><span class="linenum"> 502</span></a>        I observe them as far as I can myself, and I enquire of any one whom
<a name="l503"><span class="linenum"> 503</span></a>        they follow, and I see that a great many of them follow you, in which
<a name="l504"><span class="linenum"> 504</span></a>        they are quite right, considering your eminence in geometry and in
<a name="l505"><span class="linenum"> 505</span></a>        other ways. Tell me then, if you have met with any one who is good
<a name="l506"><span class="linenum"> 506</span></a>        for anything. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l507"><span class="linenum"> 507</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, Socrates, I have become acquainted with one very remarkable
<a name="l508"><span class="linenum"> 508</span></a>        Athenian youth, whom I commend to you as well worthy of your attention.
<a name="l509"><span class="linenum"> 509</span></a>        If he had been a beauty I should have been afraid to praise him, lest
<a name="l510"><span class="linenum"> 510</span></a>        you should suppose that I was in love with him; but he is no beauty,
<a name="l511"><span class="linenum"> 511</span></a>        and you must not be offended if I say that he is very like you; for
<a name="l512"><span class="linenum"> 512</span></a>        he has a snub nose and projecting eyes, although these features are
<a name="l513"><span class="linenum"> 513</span></a>        less marked in him than in you. Seeing, then, that he has no personal
<a name="l514"><span class="linenum"> 514</span></a>        attractions, I may freely say, that in all my acquaintance, which
<a name="l515"><span class="linenum"> 515</span></a>        is very large, I never knew anyone who was his equal in natural gifts:
<a name="l516"><span class="linenum"> 516</span></a>        for he has a quickness of apprehension which is almost unrivalled,
<a name="l517"><span class="linenum"> 517</span></a>        and he is exceedingly gentle, and also the most courageous of men;
<a name="l518"><span class="linenum"> 518</span></a>        there is a union of qualities in him such as I have never seen in
<a name="l519"><span class="linenum"> 519</span></a>        any other, and should scarcely have thought possible; for those who,
<a name="l520"><span class="linenum"> 520</span></a>        like him, have quick and ready and retentive wits, have generally
<a name="l521"><span class="linenum"> 521</span></a>        also quick tempers; they are ships without ballast, and go darting
<a name="l522"><span class="linenum"> 522</span></a>        about, and are mad rather than courageous; and the steadier sort,
<a name="l523"><span class="linenum"> 523</span></a>        when they have to face study, prove stupid and cannot remember. Whereas
<a name="l524"><span class="linenum"> 524</span></a>        he moves surely and smoothly and successfully in the path of knowledge
<a name="l525"><span class="linenum"> 525</span></a>        and enquiry; and he is full of gentleness, flowing on silently like
<a name="l526"><span class="linenum"> 526</span></a>        a river of oil; at his age, it is wonderful. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l527"><span class="linenum"> 527</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; That is good news; whose son is he? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l528"><span class="linenum"> 528</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; The name of his father I have forgotten, but the youth himself
<a name="l529"><span class="linenum"> 529</span></a>        is the middle one of those who are approaching us; he and his companions
<a name="l530"><span class="linenum"> 530</span></a>        have been anointing themselves in the outer court, and now they seem
<a name="l531"><span class="linenum"> 531</span></a>        to have finished, and are towards us. Look and see whether you know
<a name="l532"><span class="linenum"> 532</span></a>        him. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l533"><span class="linenum"> 533</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; I know the youth, but I do not know his name; he is the son of
<a name="l534"><span class="linenum"> 534</span></a>        Euphronius the Sunian, who was himself an eminent man, and such another
<a name="l535"><span class="linenum"> 535</span></a>        as his son is, according to your account of him; I believe that he
<a name="l536"><span class="linenum"> 536</span></a>        left a considerable fortune. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l537"><span class="linenum"> 537</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Theaetetus, Socrates, is his name; but I rather think that
<a name="l538"><span class="linenum"> 538</span></a>        the property disappeared in the hands of trustees; notwithstanding
<a name="l539"><span class="linenum"> 539</span></a>        which he is wonderfully liberal. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l540"><span class="linenum"> 540</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; He must be a fine fellow; tell him to come and sit by me.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l541"><span class="linenum"> 541</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; I will. Come hither, Theaetetus, and sit by Socrates.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l542"><span class="linenum"> 542</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; By all means, Theaetetus, in order that I may see the reflection
<a name="l543"><span class="linenum"> 543</span></a>        of myself in your face, for Theodorus says that we are alike; and
<a name="l544"><span class="linenum"> 544</span></a>        yet if each of us held in his hands a lyre, and he said that they
<a name="l545"><span class="linenum"> 545</span></a>        were, tuned alike, should we at once take his word, or should we ask
<a name="l546"><span class="linenum"> 546</span></a>        whether he who said so was or was not a musician? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l547"><span class="linenum"> 547</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; We should ask. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l548"><span class="linenum"> 548</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And if we found that he was, we should take his word; and if
<a name="l549"><span class="linenum"> 549</span></a>        not, not? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l550"><span class="linenum"> 550</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l551"><span class="linenum"> 551</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And if this supposed, likeness of our faces is a matter of any
<a name="l552"><span class="linenum"> 552</span></a>        interest to us we should enquire whether he who says that we are alike
<a name="l553"><span class="linenum"> 553</span></a>        is a painter or not? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l554"><span class="linenum"> 554</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly we should. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l555"><span class="linenum"> 555</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And is Theodorus a painter? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l556"><span class="linenum"> 556</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I never heard that he was. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l557"><span class="linenum"> 557</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Is he a geometrician? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l558"><span class="linenum"> 558</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Of course he is, Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l559"><span class="linenum"> 559</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And is he an astronomer and calculator and musician, and in general
<a name="l560"><span class="linenum"> 560</span></a>        an educated man? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l561"><span class="linenum"> 561</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I think so. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l562"><span class="linenum"> 562</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; If, then, he remarks on a similarity in our persons, either by
<a name="l563"><span class="linenum"> 563</span></a>        way of praise or blame, there is no particular reason why we should
<a name="l564"><span class="linenum"> 564</span></a>        attend to him. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l565"><span class="linenum"> 565</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I should say not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l566"><span class="linenum"> 566</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But if he praises the virtue or wisdom which are the mental endowments
<a name="l567"><span class="linenum"> 567</span></a>        of either of us, then he who hears the praises will naturally desire
<a name="l568"><span class="linenum"> 568</span></a>        to examine him who is praised: and he again should be willing to exhibit
<a name="l569"><span class="linenum"> 569</span></a>        himself. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l570"><span class="linenum"> 570</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true, Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l571"><span class="linenum"> 571</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then now is the time, my dear &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, for me to examine,
<a name="l572"><span class="linenum"> 572</span></a>        and for you to exhibit; since although Theodorus has praised many
<a name="l573"><span class="linenum"> 573</span></a>        a citizen and stranger in my hearing, never did I hear him praise
<a name="l574"><span class="linenum"> 574</span></a>        any one as he has been praising you. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l575"><span class="linenum"> 575</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I am glad to hear it, Socrates; but what if he was only in
<a name="l576"><span class="linenum"> 576</span></a>        jest? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l577"><span class="linenum"> 577</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Nay, Theodorus is not given to jesting; and I cannot allow you
<a name="l578"><span class="linenum"> 578</span></a>        to retract your consent on any such pretence as that. If you do, he
<a name="l579"><span class="linenum"> 579</span></a>        will have to swear to his words; and we are perfectly sure that no
<a name="l580"><span class="linenum"> 580</span></a>        one will be found to impugn him. Do not be shy then, but stand to
<a name="l581"><span class="linenum"> 581</span></a>        your word. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l582"><span class="linenum"> 582</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I suppose I must, if you wish it. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l583"><span class="linenum"> 583</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; In the first place, I should like to ask what you learn of Theodorus:
<a name="l584"><span class="linenum"> 584</span></a>        something of geometry, perhaps? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l585"><span class="linenum"> 585</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l586"><span class="linenum"> 586</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And astronomy and harmony and calculation? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l587"><span class="linenum"> 587</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I do my best. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l588"><span class="linenum"> 588</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, my boy, and so do I: and my desire is to learn of him, or
<a name="l589"><span class="linenum"> 589</span></a>        of anybody who seems to understand these things. And I get on pretty
<a name="l590"><span class="linenum"> 590</span></a>        well in general; but there is a little difficulty which I want you
<a name="l591"><span class="linenum"> 591</span></a>        and the company to aid me in investigating. Will you answer me a question:
<a name="l592"><span class="linenum"> 592</span></a>        &amp;quot;Is not learning growing wiser about that which you learn?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l593"><span class="linenum"> 593</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Of course. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l594"><span class="linenum"> 594</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And by wisdom the wise are wise? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l595"><span class="linenum"> 595</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l596"><span class="linenum"> 596</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And is that different in any way from knowledge? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l597"><span class="linenum"> 597</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; What? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l598"><span class="linenum"> 598</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Wisdom; are not men wise in that which they know? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l599"><span class="linenum"> 599</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly they are. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l600"><span class="linenum"> 600</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then wisdom and knowledge are the same? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l601"><span class="linenum"> 601</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l602"><span class="linenum"> 602</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Herein lies the difficulty which I can never solve to my satisfaction-What
<a name="l603"><span class="linenum"> 603</span></a>        is knowledge? Can we answer that question? What say you? which of
<a name="l604"><span class="linenum"> 604</span></a>        us will speak first? whoever misses shall sit down, as at a game of
<a name="l605"><span class="linenum"> 605</span></a>        ball, and shall be donkey, as the boys say; he who lasts out his competitors
<a name="l606"><span class="linenum"> 606</span></a>        in the game without missing, shall be our king, and shall have the
<a name="l607"><span class="linenum"> 607</span></a>        right of putting to us any questions which he pleases. .. Why is there
<a name="l608"><span class="linenum"> 608</span></a>        no reply? I hope, Theodorus, that I am not betrayed into rudeness
<a name="l609"><span class="linenum"> 609</span></a>        by my love of conversation? I only want to make us talk and be friendly
<a name="l610"><span class="linenum"> 610</span></a>        and sociable. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l611"><span class="linenum"> 611</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; The reverse of rudeness, Socrates: but I would rather that
<a name="l612"><span class="linenum"> 612</span></a>        you would ask one of the young fellows; for the truth is, that I am
<a name="l613"><span class="linenum"> 613</span></a>        unused to your game of question and answer, and I am too old to learn;
<a name="l614"><span class="linenum"> 614</span></a>        the young will be more suitable, and they will improve more than I
<a name="l615"><span class="linenum"> 615</span></a>        shall, for youth is always able to improve. And so having made a beginning
<a name="l616"><span class="linenum"> 616</span></a>        with &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, I would advise you to go on with him and not let
<a name="l617"><span class="linenum"> 617</span></a>        him off. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l618"><span class="linenum"> 618</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Do you hear, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, what Theodorus says? The philosopher,
<a name="l619"><span class="linenum"> 619</span></a>        whom you would not like to disobey, and whose word ought to be a command
<a name="l620"><span class="linenum"> 620</span></a>        to a young man, bids me interrogate you. Take courage, then, and nobly
<a name="l621"><span class="linenum"> 621</span></a>        say what you think that knowledge is. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l622"><span class="linenum"> 622</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Well, Socrates, I will answer as you and he bid me; and if
<a name="l623"><span class="linenum"> 623</span></a>        make a mistake, you will doubtless correct me. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l624"><span class="linenum"> 624</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; We will, if we can. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l625"><span class="linenum"> 625</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Then, I think that the sciences which I learn from Theodorus-geometry,
<a name="l626"><span class="linenum"> 626</span></a>        and those which you just now mentioned-are knowledge; and I would
<a name="l627"><span class="linenum"> 627</span></a>        include the art of the cobbler and other craftsmen; these, each and
<a name="l628"><span class="linenum"> 628</span></a>        all of, them, are knowledge. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l629"><span class="linenum"> 629</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Too much, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, too much; the nobility and liberality of
<a name="l630"><span class="linenum"> 630</span></a>        your nature make you give many and diverse things, when I am asking
<a name="l631"><span class="linenum"> 631</span></a>        for one simple thing. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l632"><span class="linenum"> 632</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; What do you mean, Socrates? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l633"><span class="linenum"> 633</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Perhaps nothing. I will endeavour, however, to explain what I
<a name="l634"><span class="linenum"> 634</span></a>        believe to be my meaning: When you speak of cobbling, you mean the
<a name="l635"><span class="linenum"> 635</span></a>        art or science of making shoes? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l636"><span class="linenum"> 636</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Just so. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l637"><span class="linenum"> 637</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And when you speak of carpentering, you mean the art of making
<a name="l638"><span class="linenum"> 638</span></a>        wooden implements? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l639"><span class="linenum"> 639</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I do. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l640"><span class="linenum"> 640</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; In both cases you define the subject matter of each of the two
<a name="l641"><span class="linenum"> 641</span></a>        arts? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l642"><span class="linenum"> 642</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l643"><span class="linenum"> 643</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But that, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, was not the point of my question: we wanted
<a name="l644"><span class="linenum"> 644</span></a>        to know not the subjects, nor yet the number of the arts or sciences,
<a name="l645"><span class="linenum"> 645</span></a>        for we were not going to count them, but we wanted to know the nature
<a name="l646"><span class="linenum"> 646</span></a>        of knowledge in the abstract. Am I not right? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l647"><span class="linenum"> 647</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Perfectly right. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l648"><span class="linenum"> 648</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Let me offer an illustration: Suppose that a person were to ask
<a name="l649"><span class="linenum"> 649</span></a>        about some very trivial and obvious thing-for example, What is clay?
<a name="l650"><span class="linenum"> 650</span></a>        and we were to reply, that there is a clay of potters, there is a
<a name="l651"><span class="linenum"> 651</span></a>        clay of oven-makers, there is a clay of brick-makers; would not the
<a name="l652"><span class="linenum"> 652</span></a>        answer be ridiculous? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l653"><span class="linenum"> 653</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Truly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l654"><span class="linenum"> 654</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; In the first place, there would be an absurdity in assuming that
<a name="l655"><span class="linenum"> 655</span></a>        he who asked the question would understand from our answer the nature
<a name="l656"><span class="linenum"> 656</span></a>        of &amp;quot;clay,&amp;quot; merely because we added &amp;quot;of the image-makers,&amp;quot; or of any
<a name="l657"><span class="linenum"> 657</span></a>        other workers. How can a man understand the name of anything, when
<a name="l658"><span class="linenum"> 658</span></a>        he does not know the nature of it? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l659"><span class="linenum"> 659</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; He cannot. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l660"><span class="linenum"> 660</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then he who does not know what science or knowledge is, has no
<a name="l661"><span class="linenum"> 661</span></a>        knowledge of the art or science of making shoes? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l662"><span class="linenum"> 662</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; None. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l663"><span class="linenum"> 663</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Nor of any other science? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l664"><span class="linenum"> 664</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; No. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l665"><span class="linenum"> 665</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And when a man is asked what science or knowledge is, to give
<a name="l666"><span class="linenum"> 666</span></a>        in answer the name of some art or science is ridiculous; for the -question
<a name="l667"><span class="linenum"> 667</span></a>        is, &amp;quot;What is knowledge?&amp;quot; and he replies, &amp;quot;A knowledge of this or that.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l668"><span class="linenum"> 668</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l669"><span class="linenum"> 669</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Moreover, he might answer shortly and simply, but he makes an
<a name="l670"><span class="linenum"> 670</span></a>        enormous circuit. For example, when asked about the day, he might
<a name="l671"><span class="linenum"> 671</span></a>        have said simply, that clay is moistened earth-what sort of clay is
<a name="l672"><span class="linenum"> 672</span></a>        not to the point. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l673"><span class="linenum"> 673</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, Socrates, there is no difficulty as you put the question.
<a name="l674"><span class="linenum"> 674</span></a>        You mean, if I am not mistaken, something like what occurred to me
<a name="l675"><span class="linenum"> 675</span></a>        and to my friend here, your namesake Socrates, in a recent discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l676"><span class="linenum"> 676</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; What was that, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l677"><span class="linenum"> 677</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Theodorus was writing out for us something about roots, such
<a name="l678"><span class="linenum"> 678</span></a>        as the roots of three or five, showing that they are incommensurable
<a name="l679"><span class="linenum"> 679</span></a>        by the unit: he selected other examples up to seventeen-there he stopped.
<a name="l680"><span class="linenum"> 680</span></a>        Now as there are innumerable roots, the notion occurred to us of attempting
<a name="l681"><span class="linenum"> 681</span></a>        to include them all under one name or class. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l682"><span class="linenum"> 682</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And did you find such a class? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l683"><span class="linenum"> 683</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I think that we did; but I should like to have your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l684"><span class="linenum"> 684</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Let me hear. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l685"><span class="linenum"> 685</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; We divided all numbers into two classes: those which are made
<a name="l686"><span class="linenum"> 686</span></a>        up of equal factors multiplying into one another, which we compared
<a name="l687"><span class="linenum"> 687</span></a>        to square figures and called square or equilateral numbers;-that was
<a name="l688"><span class="linenum"> 688</span></a>        one class. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l689"><span class="linenum"> 689</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Very good. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l690"><span class="linenum"> 690</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; The intermediate numbers, such as three and five, and every
<a name="l691"><span class="linenum"> 691</span></a>        other number which is made up of unequal factors, either of a greater
<a name="l692"><span class="linenum"> 692</span></a>        multiplied by a less, or of a less multiplied by a greater, and when
<a name="l693"><span class="linenum"> 693</span></a>        regarded as a figure, is contained in unequal sides;-all these we
<a name="l694"><span class="linenum"> 694</span></a>        compared to oblong figures, and called them oblong numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l695"><span class="linenum"> 695</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Capital; and what followed? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l696"><span class="linenum"> 696</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; The lines, or sides, which have for their squares the equilateral
<a name="l697"><span class="linenum"> 697</span></a>        plane numbers, were called by us lengths or magnitudes; and the lines
<a name="l698"><span class="linenum"> 698</span></a>        which are the roots of (or whose squares are equal to) the oblong
<a name="l699"><span class="linenum"> 699</span></a>        numbers, were called powers or roots; the reason of this latter name
<a name="l700"><span class="linenum"> 700</span></a>        being, that they are commensurable with the former 
<a name="l701"><span class="linenum"> 701</span></a>        (i.e., with the so-called lengths or magnitudes) not in linearmeasurement,
<a name="l702"><span class="linenum"> 702</span></a>        but in the value of the superficial content of their squares; and
<a name="l703"><span class="linenum"> 703</span></a>        the same about solids. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l704"><span class="linenum"> 704</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Excellent, my boys; I think that you fully justify the praises
<a name="l705"><span class="linenum"> 705</span></a>        of Theodorus, and that he will not be found guilty of false witness.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l706"><span class="linenum"> 706</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; But I am unable, Socrates, to give you a similar answer about
<a name="l707"><span class="linenum"> 707</span></a>        knowledge, which is what you appear to want; and therefore Theodorus
<a name="l708"><span class="linenum"> 708</span></a>        is a deceiver after all. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l709"><span class="linenum"> 709</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Well, but if some one were to praise you for running, and to
<a name="l710"><span class="linenum"> 710</span></a>        say that he never met your equal among boys, and afterwards you were
<a name="l711"><span class="linenum"> 711</span></a>        beaten in a race by a grown-up man, who was a great runner-would the
<a name="l712"><span class="linenum"> 712</span></a>        praise be any the less true? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l713"><span class="linenum"> 713</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l714"><span class="linenum"> 714</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And is the discovery of the nature of knowledge so small a matter,
<a name="l715"><span class="linenum"> 715</span></a>        as just now said? Is it not one which would task the powers of men
<a name="l716"><span class="linenum"> 716</span></a>        perfect in every way? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l717"><span class="linenum"> 717</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; By heaven, they should be the top of all perfection!&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l718"><span class="linenum"> 718</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Well, then, be of good cheer; do not say that Theodorus was mistaken
<a name="l719"><span class="linenum"> 719</span></a>        about you, but do your best to ascertain the true nature of knowledge,
<a name="l720"><span class="linenum"> 720</span></a>        as well as of other things. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l721"><span class="linenum"> 721</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I am eager enough, Socrates, if that would bring to light
<a name="l722"><span class="linenum"> 722</span></a>        the truth. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l723"><span class="linenum"> 723</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Come, you made a good beginning just now; let your own answer
<a name="l724"><span class="linenum"> 724</span></a>        about roots be your model, and as you comprehended them all in one
<a name="l725"><span class="linenum"> 725</span></a>        class, try and bring the many sorts of knowledge under one definition.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l726"><span class="linenum"> 726</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I can assure you, Socrates, that I have tried very often,
<a name="l727"><span class="linenum"> 727</span></a>        when the report of questions asked by you was brought to me; but I
<a name="l728"><span class="linenum"> 728</span></a>        can neither persuade myself that I have a satisfactory answer to give,
<a name="l729"><span class="linenum"> 729</span></a>        nor hear of any one who answers as you would have him; and I cannot
<a name="l730"><span class="linenum"> 730</span></a>        shake off a feeling of anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l731"><span class="linenum"> 731</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; These are the pangs of labour, my dear &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus; you have something
<a name="l732"><span class="linenum"> 732</span></a>        within you which you are bringing to the birth. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l733"><span class="linenum"> 733</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I do not know, Socrates; I only say what I feel.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l734"><span class="linenum"> 734</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And have you never heard, simpleton, that I am the son of a midwife,
<a name="l735"><span class="linenum"> 735</span></a>        brave and burly, whose name was Phaenarete? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l736"><span class="linenum"> 736</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, I have. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l737"><span class="linenum"> 737</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And that I myself practise midwifery? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l738"><span class="linenum"> 738</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; No, never. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l739"><span class="linenum"> 739</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Let me tell you that I do though, my friend: but you must not
<a name="l740"><span class="linenum"> 740</span></a>        reveal the secret, as the world in general have not found me out;
<a name="l741"><span class="linenum"> 741</span></a>        and therefore they only say of me, that I am the strangest of mortals
<a name="l742"><span class="linenum"> 742</span></a>        and drive men to their wits' end. Did you ever hear that too?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l743"><span class="linenum"> 743</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l744"><span class="linenum"> 744</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Shall I tell you the reason? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l745"><span class="linenum"> 745</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; By all means. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l746"><span class="linenum"> 746</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Bear in mind the whole business of the mid-wives, and then you
<a name="l747"><span class="linenum"> 747</span></a>        will see my meaning better:-No woman, as you are probably aware, who
<a name="l748"><span class="linenum"> 748</span></a>        is still able to conceive and bear, attends other women, but only
<a name="l749"><span class="linenum"> 749</span></a>        those who are past bearing. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l750"><span class="linenum"> 750</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes; I know. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l751"><span class="linenum"> 751</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; The reason of this is said to be that Artemis-the goddess of
<a name="l752"><span class="linenum"> 752</span></a>        childbirth-is not a mother, and she honours those who are like herself;
<a name="l753"><span class="linenum"> 753</span></a>        but she could not allow the barren to be mid-wives, because human
<a name="l754"><span class="linenum"> 754</span></a>        nature cannot know the mystery of an art without experience; and therefore
<a name="l755"><span class="linenum"> 755</span></a>        she assigned this office to those who are too old to bear.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l756"><span class="linenum"> 756</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I dare say. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l757"><span class="linenum"> 757</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And I dare say too, or rather I am absolutely certain, that the
<a name="l758"><span class="linenum"> 758</span></a>        mid-wives know better than others who is pregnant and who is not?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l759"><span class="linenum"> 759</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l760"><span class="linenum"> 760</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And by the use of potions and incantations they are able to arouse
<a name="l761"><span class="linenum"> 761</span></a>        the pangs and to soothe them at will; they can make those bear who
<a name="l762"><span class="linenum"> 762</span></a>        have a difficulty in bearing, and if they think fit they can smother
<a name="l763"><span class="linenum"> 763</span></a>        the embryo in the womb. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l764"><span class="linenum"> 764</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; They can. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l765"><span class="linenum"> 765</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Did you ever remark that they are also most cunning matchmakers,
<a name="l766"><span class="linenum"> 766</span></a>        and have a thorough knowledge of what unions are likely to produce
<a name="l767"><span class="linenum"> 767</span></a>        a brave brood? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l768"><span class="linenum"> 768</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; No, never. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l769"><span class="linenum"> 769</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then let me tell you that this is their greatest pride, more
<a name="l770"><span class="linenum"> 770</span></a>        than cutting the umbilical cord. And if you reflect, you will see
<a name="l771"><span class="linenum"> 771</span></a>        that the same art which cultivates and gathers in the fruits of the
<a name="l772"><span class="linenum"> 772</span></a>        earth, will be most likely to know in what soils the several plants
<a name="l773"><span class="linenum"> 773</span></a>        or seeds should be deposited. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l774"><span class="linenum"> 774</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, the same art. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l775"><span class="linenum"> 775</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And do you suppose that with women the case is otherwise?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l776"><span class="linenum"> 776</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I should think not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l777"><span class="linenum"> 777</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly not; but mid-wives are respectable women who have a
<a name="l778"><span class="linenum"> 778</span></a>        character to lose, and they avoid this department of their profession,
<a name="l779"><span class="linenum"> 779</span></a>        because they are afraid of being called procuresses, which is a name
<a name="l780"><span class="linenum"> 780</span></a>        given to those who join together man and woman in an unlawful and
<a name="l781"><span class="linenum"> 781</span></a>        unscientific way; and yet the true midwife is also the true and only
<a name="l782"><span class="linenum"> 782</span></a>        matchmaker. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l783"><span class="linenum"> 783</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l784"><span class="linenum"> 784</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Such are the mid-wives, whose task is a very important one but
<a name="l785"><span class="linenum"> 785</span></a>        not so important as mine; for women do not bring into the world at
<a name="l786"><span class="linenum"> 786</span></a>        one time real children, and at another time counterfeits which are
<a name="l787"><span class="linenum"> 787</span></a>        with difficulty distinguished from them; if they did, then the, discernment
<a name="l788"><span class="linenum"> 788</span></a>        of the true and false birth would be the crowning achievement of the
<a name="l789"><span class="linenum"> 789</span></a>        art of midwifery-you would think so? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l790"><span class="linenum"> 790</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Indeed I should. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l791"><span class="linenum"> 791</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Well, my art of midwifery is in most respects like theirs; but
<a name="l792"><span class="linenum"> 792</span></a>        differs, in that I attend men and not women; and look after their
<a name="l793"><span class="linenum"> 793</span></a>        souls when they are in labour, and not after their bodies: and the
<a name="l794"><span class="linenum"> 794</span></a>        triumph of my art is in thoroughly examining whether the thought which
<a name="l795"><span class="linenum"> 795</span></a>        the mind of the young man brings forth is a false idol or a noble
<a name="l796"><span class="linenum"> 796</span></a>        and true birth. And like the mid-wives, I am barren, and the reproach
<a name="l797"><span class="linenum"> 797</span></a>        which is often made against me, that I ask questions of others and
<a name="l798"><span class="linenum"> 798</span></a>        have not the wit to answer them myself, is very just-the reason is,
<a name="l799"><span class="linenum"> 799</span></a>        that the god compels-me to be a midwife, but does not allow me to
<a name="l800"><span class="linenum"> 800</span></a>        bring forth. And therefore I am not myself at all wise, nor have I
<a name="l801"><span class="linenum"> 801</span></a>        anything to show which is the invention or birth of my own soul, but
<a name="l802"><span class="linenum"> 802</span></a>        those who converse with me profit. Some of them appear dull enough
<a name="l803"><span class="linenum"> 803</span></a>        at first, but afterwards, as our acquaintance ripens, if the god is
<a name="l804"><span class="linenum"> 804</span></a>        gracious to them, they all make astonishing progress; and this in
<a name="l805"><span class="linenum"> 805</span></a>        the opinion of others as well as in their own. It is quite dear that
<a name="l806"><span class="linenum"> 806</span></a>        they never learned anything from me; the many fine discoveries to
<a name="l807"><span class="linenum"> 807</span></a>        which they cling are of their own making. But to me and the god they
<a name="l808"><span class="linenum"> 808</span></a>        owe their delivery. And the proof of my words is, that many of them
<a name="l809"><span class="linenum"> 809</span></a>        in their ignorance, either in their self-conceit despising me, or
<a name="l810"><span class="linenum"> 810</span></a>        falling under the influence of others, have gone away too soon; and
<a name="l811"><span class="linenum"> 811</span></a>        have not only lost the children of whom I had previously delivered
<a name="l812"><span class="linenum"> 812</span></a>        them by an ill bringing up, but have stifled whatever else they had
<a name="l813"><span class="linenum"> 813</span></a>        in them by evil communications, being fonder of lies and shams than
<a name="l814"><span class="linenum"> 814</span></a>        of the truth; and they have at last ended by seeing themselves, as
<a name="l815"><span class="linenum"> 815</span></a>        others see them, to be great fools. Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus,
<a name="l816"><span class="linenum"> 816</span></a>        is one of them, and there are many others. The truants often return
<a name="l817"><span class="linenum"> 817</span></a>        to me, and beg that I would consort with them again-they are ready
<a name="l818"><span class="linenum"> 818</span></a>        to go to me on their knees and then, if my familiar allows, which
<a name="l819"><span class="linenum"> 819</span></a>        is not always the case, I receive them, and they begin to grow again.
<a name="l820"><span class="linenum"> 820</span></a>        Dire are the pangs which my art is able to arouse and to allay in
<a name="l821"><span class="linenum"> 821</span></a>        those who consort with me, just like the pangs of women in childbirth;
<a name="l822"><span class="linenum"> 822</span></a>        night and day they are full of perplexity and travail which is even
<a name="l823"><span class="linenum"> 823</span></a>        worse than that of the women. So much for them. And there are -others,
<a name="l824"><span class="linenum"> 824</span></a>        &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, who come to me apparently having nothing in them; and
<a name="l825"><span class="linenum"> 825</span></a>        as I know that they have no need of my art, I coax them into marrying
<a name="l826"><span class="linenum"> 826</span></a>        some one, and by the grace of God I can generally tell who is likely
<a name="l827"><span class="linenum"> 827</span></a>        to do them good. Many of them I have given away to Prodicus, and many
<a name="l828"><span class="linenum"> 828</span></a>        to other inspired sages. I tell you this long story, friend &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus,
<a name="l829"><span class="linenum"> 829</span></a>        because I suspect, as indeed you seem to think yourself, that you
<a name="l830"><span class="linenum"> 830</span></a>        are in labour-great with some conception. Come then to me, who am
<a name="l831"><span class="linenum"> 831</span></a>        a midwife's son and myself a midwife, and do your best to answer the
<a name="l832"><span class="linenum"> 832</span></a>        questions which I will ask you. And if I abstract and expose your
<a name="l833"><span class="linenum"> 833</span></a>        first-born, because I discover upon inspection that the conception
<a name="l834"><span class="linenum"> 834</span></a>        which you have formed is a vain shadow, do not quarrel with me on
<a name="l835"><span class="linenum"> 835</span></a>        that account, as the manner of women is when their first children
<a name="l836"><span class="linenum"> 836</span></a>        are taken from them. For I have actually known some who were ready
<a name="l837"><span class="linenum"> 837</span></a>        to bite me when I deprived them of a darling folly; they did not perceive
<a name="l838"><span class="linenum"> 838</span></a>        that I acted from good will, not knowing that no god is the enemy
<a name="l839"><span class="linenum"> 839</span></a>        of man-that was not within the range of their ideas; neither am I
<a name="l840"><span class="linenum"> 840</span></a>        their enemy in all this, but it would be wrong for me to admit falsehood,
<a name="l841"><span class="linenum"> 841</span></a>        or to stifle the truth. Once more, then, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, I repeat my old
<a name="l842"><span class="linenum"> 842</span></a>        question, &amp;quot;What is knowledge?&amp;quot;-and do not say that you cannot tell;
<a name="l843"><span class="linenum"> 843</span></a>        but quit yourself like a man, and by the help of God you will be able
<a name="l844"><span class="linenum"> 844</span></a>        to tell. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l845"><span class="linenum"> 845</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; At any rate, Socrates, after such an exhortation I should
<a name="l846"><span class="linenum"> 846</span></a>        be ashamed of not trying to do my best. Now he who knows perceives
<a name="l847"><span class="linenum"> 847</span></a>        what he knows, and, as far as I can see at present, knowledge is perception.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l848"><span class="linenum"> 848</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Bravely said, boy; that is the way in which you should express
<a name="l849"><span class="linenum"> 849</span></a>        your opinion. And now, let us examine together this conception of
<a name="l850"><span class="linenum"> 850</span></a>        yours, and see whether it is a true birth or a mere, wind-egg:-You
<a name="l851"><span class="linenum"> 851</span></a>        say that knowledge is perception? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l852"><span class="linenum"> 852</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l853"><span class="linenum"> 853</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Well, you have delivered yourself of a very important doctrine
<a name="l854"><span class="linenum"> 854</span></a>        about knowledge; it is indeed the opinion of Protagoras, who has another
<a name="l855"><span class="linenum"> 855</span></a>        way of expressing it, Man, he says, is the measure of all things,
<a name="l856"><span class="linenum"> 856</span></a>        of the existence of things that are, and of the non-existence of things
<a name="l857"><span class="linenum"> 857</span></a>        that are not:-You have read him? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l858"><span class="linenum"> 858</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; O yes, again and again. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l859"><span class="linenum"> 859</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Does he not say that things are to you such as they appear to
<a name="l860"><span class="linenum"> 860</span></a>        you, and to me such as they appear to me, and that you and I are men?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l861"><span class="linenum"> 861</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, he says so. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l862"><span class="linenum"> 862</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; A wise man is not likely to talk nonsense. Let us try to understand
<a name="l863"><span class="linenum"> 863</span></a>        him: the same wind is blowing, and yet one of us may be cold and the
<a name="l864"><span class="linenum"> 864</span></a>        other not, or one may be slightly and the other very cold?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l865"><span class="linenum"> 865</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Quite true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l866"><span class="linenum"> 866</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Now is the wind, regarded not in relation to us but absolutely,
<a name="l867"><span class="linenum"> 867</span></a>        cold or not; or are we to say, with Protagoras, that the wind is cold
<a name="l868"><span class="linenum"> 868</span></a>        to him who is cold, and not to him who is not? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l869"><span class="linenum"> 869</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I suppose the last. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l870"><span class="linenum"> 870</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then it must appear so to each of them? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l871"><span class="linenum"> 871</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l872"><span class="linenum"> 872</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And &amp;quot;appears to him&amp;quot; means the same as &amp;quot;he perceives.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l873"><span class="linenum"> 873</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l874"><span class="linenum"> 874</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then appearing and perceiving coincide in the case of hot and
<a name="l875"><span class="linenum"> 875</span></a>        cold, and in similar instances; for things appear, or may be supposed
<a name="l876"><span class="linenum"> 876</span></a>        to be, to each one such as he perceives them? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l877"><span class="linenum"> 877</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l878"><span class="linenum"> 878</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then perception is always of existence, and being the same as
<a name="l879"><span class="linenum"> 879</span></a>        knowledge is unerring? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l880"><span class="linenum"> 880</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l881"><span class="linenum"> 881</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; In the name of the Graces, what an almighty wise man Protagoras
<a name="l882"><span class="linenum"> 882</span></a>        must have been! He spoke these things in a parable to the common herd,
<a name="l883"><span class="linenum"> 883</span></a>        like you and me, but told the truth, his Truth, in secret to his own
<a name="l884"><span class="linenum"> 884</span></a>        disciples. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l885"><span class="linenum"> 885</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; What do you mean, Socrates? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l886"><span class="linenum"> 886</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; I am about to speak of a high argument, in which all things are
<a name="l887"><span class="linenum"> 887</span></a>        said to be relative; you cannot rightly call anything by any name,
<a name="l888"><span class="linenum"> 888</span></a>        such as great or small, heavy or light, for the great will be small
<a name="l889"><span class="linenum"> 889</span></a>        and the heavy light-there is no single thing or quality, but out of
<a name="l890"><span class="linenum"> 890</span></a>        motion and change and admixture all things are becoming relatively
<a name="l891"><span class="linenum"> 891</span></a>        to one another, which &amp;quot;becoming&amp;quot; is by us incorrectly called being,
<a name="l892"><span class="linenum"> 892</span></a>        but is really becoming, for nothing ever is, but all things are becoming.
<a name="l893"><span class="linenum"> 893</span></a>        Summon all philosophers-Protagoras, Heracleitus, Empedocles, and the
<a name="l894"><span class="linenum"> 894</span></a>        rest of them, one after another, and with the exception of Parmenides
<a name="l895"><span class="linenum"> 895</span></a>        they will agree with you in this. Summon the great masters of either
<a name="l896"><span class="linenum"> 896</span></a>        kind of poetry-Epicharmus, the prince of Comedy, and Homer of Tragedy;
<a name="l897"><span class="linenum"> 897</span></a>        when the latter sings of &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l898"><span class="linenum"> 898</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;Ocean whence sprang the gods, and mother Tethys, does he not mean
<a name="l899"><span class="linenum"> 899</span></a>        that all things are the offspring, of flux and motion? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l900"><span class="linenum"> 900</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I think so. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l901"><span class="linenum"> 901</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And who could take up arms against such a great army having Homer
<a name="l902"><span class="linenum"> 902</span></a>        for its general, and not appear ridiculous? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l903"><span class="linenum"> 903</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Who indeed, Socrates? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l904"><span class="linenum"> 904</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus; and there are plenty of other proofs which will
<a name="l905"><span class="linenum"> 905</span></a>        show that motion is the source of what is called being and becoming,
<a name="l906"><span class="linenum"> 906</span></a>        and inactivity of not-being and destruction; for fire and warmth,
<a name="l907"><span class="linenum"> 907</span></a>        which are supposed to be the parent and guardian of all other things,
<a name="l908"><span class="linenum"> 908</span></a>        are born of movement and friction, which is a kind of motion;-is not
<a name="l909"><span class="linenum"> 909</span></a>        this the origin of fire? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l910"><span class="linenum"> 910</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; It is. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l911"><span class="linenum"> 911</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And the race of animals is generated in the same way?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l912"><span class="linenum"> 912</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l913"><span class="linenum"> 913</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And is not the bodily habit spoiled by rest and idleness, but
<a name="l914"><span class="linenum"> 914</span></a>        preserved for a long time by motion and exercise? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l915"><span class="linenum"> 915</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l916"><span class="linenum"> 916</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And what of the mental habit? Is not the soul informed, and improved,
<a name="l917"><span class="linenum"> 917</span></a>        and preserved by study and attention, which are motions; but when
<a name="l918"><span class="linenum"> 918</span></a>        at rest, which in the soul only means want of attention and study,
<a name="l919"><span class="linenum"> 919</span></a>        is uninformed, and speedily forgets whatever she has learned?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l920"><span class="linenum"> 920</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l921"><span class="linenum"> 921</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then motion is a good, and rest an evil, to the soul as well
<a name="l922"><span class="linenum"> 922</span></a>        as to the body? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l923"><span class="linenum"> 923</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l924"><span class="linenum"> 924</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; I may add, that breathless calm, stillness and the like waste
<a name="l925"><span class="linenum"> 925</span></a>        and impair, while wind and storm preserve; and the palmary argument
<a name="l926"><span class="linenum"> 926</span></a>        of all, which I strongly urge, is the golden chain in Homer, by which
<a name="l927"><span class="linenum"> 927</span></a>        he means the sun, thereby indicating that so long as the sun and the
<a name="l928"><span class="linenum"> 928</span></a>        heavens go round in their orbits, all things human and divine are
<a name="l929"><span class="linenum"> 929</span></a>        and are preserved, but if they were chained up and their motions ceased,
<a name="l930"><span class="linenum"> 930</span></a>        then all things would be destroyed, and, as the saying is, turned
<a name="l931"><span class="linenum"> 931</span></a>        upside down. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l932"><span class="linenum"> 932</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I believe, Socrates, that you have truly explained his meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l933"><span class="linenum"> 933</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then now apply his doctrine to perception, my good friend, and
<a name="l934"><span class="linenum"> 934</span></a>        first of all to vision; that which you call white colour is not in
<a name="l935"><span class="linenum"> 935</span></a>        your eyes, and is not a distinct thing which exists out of them. And
<a name="l936"><span class="linenum"> 936</span></a>        you must not assign any place to it: for if it had position it would
<a name="l937"><span class="linenum"> 937</span></a>        be, and be at rest, and there would be no process of becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l938"><span class="linenum"> 938</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Then what is colour? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l939"><span class="linenum"> 939</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Let us carry the principle which has just been affirmed, that
<a name="l940"><span class="linenum"> 940</span></a>        nothing is self-existent, and then we shall see that white, black,
<a name="l941"><span class="linenum"> 941</span></a>        and every other colour, arises out of the eye meeting the appropriate
<a name="l942"><span class="linenum"> 942</span></a>        motion, and that what we call a colour is in each case neither the
<a name="l943"><span class="linenum"> 943</span></a>        active nor the passive element, but something which passes between
<a name="l944"><span class="linenum"> 944</span></a>        them, and is peculiar to each percipient; are you quite certain that
<a name="l945"><span class="linenum"> 945</span></a>        the several colours appear to a dog or to any animal whatever as they
<a name="l946"><span class="linenum"> 946</span></a>        appear to you? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l947"><span class="linenum"> 947</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Far from it. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l948"><span class="linenum"> 948</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Or that anything appears the same to you as to another man? Are
<a name="l949"><span class="linenum"> 949</span></a>        you so profoundly convinced of this? Rather would it not be true that
<a name="l950"><span class="linenum"> 950</span></a>        it never appears exactly the same to you, because you are never exactly
<a name="l951"><span class="linenum"> 951</span></a>        the same? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l952"><span class="linenum"> 952</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; The latter. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l953"><span class="linenum"> 953</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And if that with which I compare myself in size, or which I apprehend
<a name="l954"><span class="linenum"> 954</span></a>        by touch, were great or white or hot, it could not become different
<a name="l955"><span class="linenum"> 955</span></a>        by mere contact with another unless it actually changed; nor again,
<a name="l956"><span class="linenum"> 956</span></a>        if the comparing or apprehending subject were great or white or hot,
<a name="l957"><span class="linenum"> 957</span></a>        could this, when unchanged from within become changed by any approximation
<a name="l958"><span class="linenum"> 958</span></a>        or affection of any other thing. The fact is that in our ordinary
<a name="l959"><span class="linenum"> 959</span></a>        way of speaking we allow ourselves to be driven into most ridiculous
<a name="l960"><span class="linenum"> 960</span></a>        and wonderful contradictions, as Protagoras and all who take his line
<a name="l961"><span class="linenum"> 961</span></a>        of argument would remark. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l962"><span class="linenum"> 962</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; How? and of what sort do you mean? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l963"><span class="linenum"> 963</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; A little instance will sufficiently explain my meaning: Here
<a name="l964"><span class="linenum"> 964</span></a>        are six dice, which are more by a half when compared with four, and
<a name="l965"><span class="linenum"> 965</span></a>        fewer by a half than twelve-they are more and also fewer. How can
<a name="l966"><span class="linenum"> 966</span></a>        you or any one maintain the contrary? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l967"><span class="linenum"> 967</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l968"><span class="linenum"> 968</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Well, then, suppose that Protagoras or some one asks whether
<a name="l969"><span class="linenum"> 969</span></a>        anything can become greater or more if not by increasing, how would
<a name="l970"><span class="linenum"> 970</span></a>        you answer him, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l971"><span class="linenum"> 971</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I should say &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; Socrates, if I were to speak my mind in
<a name="l972"><span class="linenum"> 972</span></a>        reference to this last question, and if I were not afraid of contradicting
<a name="l973"><span class="linenum"> 973</span></a>        my former answer. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l974"><span class="linenum"> 974</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Capital excellent! spoken like an oracle, my boy! And if you
<a name="l975"><span class="linenum"> 975</span></a>        reply &amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; there will be a case for Euripides; for our tongue will
<a name="l976"><span class="linenum"> 976</span></a>        be unconvinced, but not our mind. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l977"><span class="linenum"> 977</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l978"><span class="linenum"> 978</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; The thoroughbred Sophists, who know all that can be known about
<a name="l979"><span class="linenum"> 979</span></a>        the mind, and argue only out of the superfluity of their wits, would
<a name="l980"><span class="linenum"> 980</span></a>        have had a regular sparring-match over this, and would -have knocked
<a name="l981"><span class="linenum"> 981</span></a>        their arguments together finely. But you and I, who have no professional
<a name="l982"><span class="linenum"> 982</span></a>        aims, only desire to see what is the mutual relation of these principles-whether
<a name="l983"><span class="linenum"> 983</span></a>        they are consistent with each or not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l984"><span class="linenum"> 984</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, that would be my desire. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l985"><span class="linenum"> 985</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And mine too. But since this is our feeling, and there is plenty
<a name="l986"><span class="linenum"> 986</span></a>        of time, why should we not calmly and patiently review our own thoughts,
<a name="l987"><span class="linenum"> 987</span></a>        and thoroughly examine and see what these appearances in us really
<a name="l988"><span class="linenum"> 988</span></a>        are? If I am not mistaken, they will be described by us as follows:-first,
<a name="l989"><span class="linenum"> 989</span></a>        that nothing can become greater or less, either in number or magnitude,
<a name="l990"><span class="linenum"> 990</span></a>        while remaining equal to itself-you would agree? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l991"><span class="linenum"> 991</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l992"><span class="linenum"> 992</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Secondly, that without addition or subtraction there is no increase
<a name="l993"><span class="linenum"> 993</span></a>        or diminution of anything, but only equality. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l994"><span class="linenum"> 994</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Quite true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l995"><span class="linenum"> 995</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Thirdly, that what was not before cannot be afterwards, without
<a name="l996"><span class="linenum"> 996</span></a>  
<a name="l997"><span class="linenum"> 997</span></a>        becoming and having become. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l998"><span class="linenum"> 998</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, truly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l999"><span class="linenum"> 999</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; These three axioms, if I am not mistaken, are fighting with one
<a name="l1000"><span class="linenum">1000</span></a>        another in our minds in the case of the dice, or, again, in such a
<a name="l1001"><span class="linenum">1001</span></a>        case as this-if I were to say that I, who am of a certain height and
<a name="l1002"><span class="linenum">1002</span></a>        taller than you, may within a year, without gaining or losing in height,
<a name="l1003"><span class="linenum">1003</span></a>        be not so tall-not that I should have lost, but that you would have
<a name="l1004"><span class="linenum">1004</span></a>        increased. In such a case, I am afterwards what I once was not, and
<a name="l1005"><span class="linenum">1005</span></a>        yet I have not become; for I could not have become without becoming,
<a name="l1006"><span class="linenum">1006</span></a>        neither could I have become less without losing somewhat of my height;
<a name="l1007"><span class="linenum">1007</span></a>        and I could give you ten thousand examples of similar contradictions,
<a name="l1008"><span class="linenum">1008</span></a>        if we admit them at all. I believe that you follow me, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus;
<a name="l1009"><span class="linenum">1009</span></a>        for I suspect that you have thought of these questions before now.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1010"><span class="linenum">1010</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, Socrates, and I am amazed when I think of them; by the
<a name="l1011"><span class="linenum">1011</span></a>        Gods I am! and I want to know what on earth they mean; and there are
<a name="l1012"><span class="linenum">1012</span></a>        times when my head quite swims with the contemplation of them.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1013"><span class="linenum">1013</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; I see, my dear &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, that Theodorus had a true insight
<a name="l1014"><span class="linenum">1014</span></a>        into your nature when he said that you were a philosopher, for wonder
<a name="l1015"><span class="linenum">1015</span></a>        is the feeling of a philosopher, and philosophy begins in wonder.
<a name="l1016"><span class="linenum">1016</span></a>        He was not a bad genealogist who said that Iris (the messenger of
<a name="l1017"><span class="linenum">1017</span></a>        heaven) is the child of Thaumas (wonder). But do you begin to see
<a name="l1018"><span class="linenum">1018</span></a>        what is the explanation of this perplexity on the hypothesis which
<a name="l1019"><span class="linenum">1019</span></a>        we attribute to Protagoras? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1020"><span class="linenum">1020</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Not as yet. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1021"><span class="linenum">1021</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then you will be obliged to me if I help you to unearth the hidden
<a name="l1022"><span class="linenum">1022</span></a>        &amp;quot;truth&amp;quot; of a famous man or school. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1023"><span class="linenum">1023</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; To be sure, I shall be very much obliged. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1024"><span class="linenum">1024</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Take a look round, then, and see that none of the uninitiated
<a name="l1025"><span class="linenum">1025</span></a>        are listening. Now by the uninitiated I mean: the people who believe
<a name="l1026"><span class="linenum">1026</span></a>        in nothing but what they can grasp in their hands, and who will not
<a name="l1027"><span class="linenum">1027</span></a>        allow that action or generation or anything invisible can have real
<a name="l1028"><span class="linenum">1028</span></a>        existence. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1029"><span class="linenum">1029</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, indeed, Socrates, they are very hard and impenetrable
<a name="l1030"><span class="linenum">1030</span></a>        mortals. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1031"><span class="linenum">1031</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, my boy, outer barbarians. Far more ingenious are the brethren
<a name="l1032"><span class="linenum">1032</span></a>        whose mysteries I am about to reveal to you. Their first principle
<a name="l1033"><span class="linenum">1033</span></a>        is, that all is motion, and upon this all the affections of which
<a name="l1034"><span class="linenum">1034</span></a>        we were just now speaking, are supposed to depend: there is nothing
<a name="l1035"><span class="linenum">1035</span></a>        but motion, which has two forms, one active and the other passive,
<a name="l1036"><span class="linenum">1036</span></a>        both in endless number; and out of the union and friction of them
<a name="l1037"><span class="linenum">1037</span></a>        there is generated a progeny endless in number, having two forms,
<a name="l1038"><span class="linenum">1038</span></a>        sense and the object of sense, which are ever breaking forth and coming
<a name="l1039"><span class="linenum">1039</span></a>        to the birth at the same moment. The senses are variously named hearing,
<a name="l1040"><span class="linenum">1040</span></a>        seeing, smelling; there is the sense of heat, cold, pleasure, pain,
<a name="l1041"><span class="linenum">1041</span></a>        desire, fear, and many more which have names, as well as innumerable
<a name="l1042"><span class="linenum">1042</span></a>        others which are without them; each has its kindred object each variety
<a name="l1043"><span class="linenum">1043</span></a>        of colour has a corresponding variety of sight, and so with sound
<a name="l1044"><span class="linenum">1044</span></a>        and hearing, and with the rest of the senses and the objects akin
<a name="l1045"><span class="linenum">1045</span></a>        to them. Do you see, &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, the bearings of this tale on the
<a name="l1046"><span class="linenum">1046</span></a>        preceding argument? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1047"><span class="linenum">1047</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Indeed I do not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1048"><span class="linenum">1048</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then attend, and I will try to finish the story. The purport
<a name="l1049"><span class="linenum">1049</span></a>        is that all these things are in motion, as I was saying, and that
<a name="l1050"><span class="linenum">1050</span></a>        this motion is of two kinds, a slower and a quicker; and the slower
<a name="l1051"><span class="linenum">1051</span></a>        elements have their motions in the same place and with reference to
<a name="l1052"><span class="linenum">1052</span></a>        things near them, and so they beget; but what is begotten is swifter,
<a name="l1053"><span class="linenum">1053</span></a>        for it is carried to fro, and moves from place to place. Apply this
<a name="l1054"><span class="linenum">1054</span></a>        to sense:-When the eye and the appropriate object meet together and
<a name="l1055"><span class="linenum">1055</span></a>        give birth to whiteness and the sensation connatural with it, which
<a name="l1056"><span class="linenum">1056</span></a>        could not have been given by either of them going elsewhere, then,
<a name="l1057"><span class="linenum">1057</span></a>        while the sight: is flowing from the eye, whiteness proceeds from
<a name="l1058"><span class="linenum">1058</span></a>        the object which combines in producing the colour; and so the eye
<a name="l1059"><span class="linenum">1059</span></a>        is fulfilled with sight, and really sees, and becomes, not sight,
<a name="l1060"><span class="linenum">1060</span></a>        but a seeing eye; and the object which combined to form the colour
<a name="l1061"><span class="linenum">1061</span></a>        is fulfilled with whiteness, and becomes not whiteness but a white
<a name="l1062"><span class="linenum">1062</span></a>        thing, whether wood or stone or whatever the object may be which happens
<a name="l1063"><span class="linenum">1063</span></a>        to be colour,ed white. And this is true of all sensible objects, hard,
<a name="l1064"><span class="linenum">1064</span></a>        warm, and the like, which are similarly to be regarded, as I was saying
<a name="l1065"><span class="linenum">1065</span></a>        before, not as having any absolute existence, but as being all of
<a name="l1066"><span class="linenum">1066</span></a>        them of whatever kind. generated by motion in their intercourse with
<a name="l1067"><span class="linenum">1067</span></a>        one another; for of the agent and patient, as existing in separation,
<a name="l1068"><span class="linenum">1068</span></a>        no trustworthy conception, as they say, can be formed, for the agent
<a name="l1069"><span class="linenum">1069</span></a>        has no existence until united; with the patient, and the patient has
<a name="l1070"><span class="linenum">1070</span></a>        no existence until united with the agent; and that which by uniting
<a name="l1071"><span class="linenum">1071</span></a>        with something becomes an agent, by meeting with some other thing
<a name="l1072"><span class="linenum">1072</span></a>        is converted into a patient. And from all these considerations, as
<a name="l1073"><span class="linenum">1073</span></a>        I said at first, there arises a general reflection, that there is
<a name="l1074"><span class="linenum">1074</span></a>        no one self-existent thing, but everything is becoming and in relation;
<a name="l1075"><span class="linenum">1075</span></a>        and being must be altogether abolished, although from habit and ignorance
<a name="l1076"><span class="linenum">1076</span></a>        we are compelled even in this discussion to retain the use of the
<a name="l1077"><span class="linenum">1077</span></a>        term. But great philosophers tell us that we are not to allow either
<a name="l1078"><span class="linenum">1078</span></a>        the word &amp;quot;something,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;belonging to something,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;to me,&amp;quot; or
<a name="l1079"><span class="linenum">1079</span></a>        &amp;quot;this,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;that,&amp;quot; or any other detaining name to be used, in the
<a name="l1080"><span class="linenum">1080</span></a>        language of nature all things are being created and destroyed, coming
<a name="l1081"><span class="linenum">1081</span></a>        into being and passing into new forms; nor can any name fix or detain
<a name="l1082"><span class="linenum">1082</span></a>        them; he who attempts to fix them is easily refuted. And this should
<a name="l1083"><span class="linenum">1083</span></a>        be the way of speaking, not only of particulars but of aggregates
<a name="l1084"><span class="linenum">1084</span></a>        such aggregates as are expressed in the word &amp;quot;man,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;stone,&amp;quot; or
<a name="l1085"><span class="linenum">1085</span></a>        any name of animal or of a class. O &lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, are not these speculations
<a name="l1086"><span class="linenum">1086</span></a>        sweet as honey? And do you not like the taste of them in the mouth?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1087"><span class="linenum">1087</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I do not know what to say, Socrates, for, indeed, I cannot
<a name="l1088"><span class="linenum">1088</span></a>        make out whether you are giving your own opinion or only wanting to
<a name="l1089"><span class="linenum">1089</span></a>        draw me out. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1090"><span class="linenum">1090</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; You forget, my friend, that I neither know, nor profess to know,
<a name="l1091"><span class="linenum">1091</span></a>        anything of! these matters; you are the person who is in labour, I
<a name="l1092"><span class="linenum">1092</span></a>        am the barren midwife; and this is why I soothe you, and offer you
<a name="l1093"><span class="linenum">1093</span></a>        one good thing after another, that you may taste them. And I hope
<a name="l1094"><span class="linenum">1094</span></a>        that I may at last help to bring your own opinion into the light of
<a name="l1095"><span class="linenum">1095</span></a>        day: when this has been accomplished, then we will determine whether
<a name="l1096"><span class="linenum">1096</span></a>        what you have brought forth is only a wind-egg or a real and genuine
<a name="l1097"><span class="linenum">1097</span></a>        birth. Therefore, keep up your spirits, and answer like a man what
<a name="l1098"><span class="linenum">1098</span></a>        you think. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1099"><span class="linenum">1099</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Ask me. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1100"><span class="linenum">1100</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then once more: Is it your opinion that nothing is but what becomes?
<a name="l1101"><span class="linenum">1101</span></a>        the good and the noble, as well; as all the other things which we
<a name="l1102"><span class="linenum">1102</span></a>        were just now mentioning? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1103"><span class="linenum">1103</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; When I hear you discoursing in this style, I think that there
<a name="l1104"><span class="linenum">1104</span></a>        is a great deal in what you say, and I am very ready to assent. Soc.
<a name="l1105"><span class="linenum">1105</span></a>        Let us not leave the argument unfinished, then; for there still remains
<a name="l1106"><span class="linenum">1106</span></a>        to be considered an objection which may be raised about dreams and
<a name="l1107"><span class="linenum">1107</span></a>        diseases, in particular about madness, and the various illusions of
<a name="l1108"><span class="linenum">1108</span></a>        hearing and sight, or of other senses. For you know that in all these
<a name="l1109"><span class="linenum">1109</span></a>        cases the esse-percipi theory appears to be unmistakably refuted,
<a name="l1110"><span class="linenum">1110</span></a>        since in dreams and illusions we certainly have false perceptions;
<a name="l1111"><span class="linenum">1111</span></a>        and far from saying that everything is which appears, we should rather
<a name="l1112"><span class="linenum">1112</span></a>        say that nothing is which appears. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1113"><span class="linenum">1113</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true, Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1114"><span class="linenum">1114</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But then, my boy, how can any one contend that knowledge is perception,
<a name="l1115"><span class="linenum">1115</span></a>        or that to every man what appears is? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1116"><span class="linenum">1116</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I am afraid to say, Socrates, that I have nothing to answer,
<a name="l1117"><span class="linenum">1117</span></a>        because you rebuked me just now for making this excuse; but I certainly
<a name="l1118"><span class="linenum">1118</span></a>        cannot undertake to argue that madmen or dreamers think truly, when
<a name="l1119"><span class="linenum">1119</span></a>        they imagine, some of them that they are gods, and others that they
<a name="l1120"><span class="linenum">1120</span></a>        can fly, and are flying in their sleep. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1121"><span class="linenum">1121</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Do you see another question which can be raised about these phenomena,
<a name="l1122"><span class="linenum">1122</span></a>        notably about dreaming and waking? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1123"><span class="linenum">1123</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; What question? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1124"><span class="linenum">1124</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; A question which I think that you must often have heard persons
<a name="l1125"><span class="linenum">1125</span></a>        ask:-How can you determine whether at this moment we are sleeping,
<a name="l1126"><span class="linenum">1126</span></a>        and all our thoughts are a dream; or whether we are awake, and talking
<a name="l1127"><span class="linenum">1127</span></a>        to one another in the waking state? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1128"><span class="linenum">1128</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Indeed, Socrates, I do not know how to prove the one any more
<a name="l1129"><span class="linenum">1129</span></a>        than the other, for in both cases the facts precisely correspond;-and
<a name="l1130"><span class="linenum">1130</span></a>        there is no difficulty in supposing that during all this discussion
<a name="l1131"><span class="linenum">1131</span></a>        we have been talking to one another in a dream; and when in a dream
<a name="l1132"><span class="linenum">1132</span></a>        we seem to be narrating dreams, the resemblance of the two states
<a name="l1133"><span class="linenum">1133</span></a>        is quite astonishing. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1134"><span class="linenum">1134</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; You see, then, that a doubt about the reality of sense is easily
<a name="l1135"><span class="linenum">1135</span></a>        raised, since there may even be a doubt whether we are awake or in
<a name="l1136"><span class="linenum">1136</span></a>        a dream. And as our time is equally divided between sleeping and waking,
<a name="l1137"><span class="linenum">1137</span></a>        in either sphere of existence the soul contends that the thoughts
<a name="l1138"><span class="linenum">1138</span></a>        which are present to our minds at the time are true; and during one
<a name="l1139"><span class="linenum">1139</span></a>        half of our lives we affirm the truth of the one, and, during the
<a name="l1140"><span class="linenum">1140</span></a>        other half, of the other; and are equally confident of both.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1141"><span class="linenum">1141</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Most true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1142"><span class="linenum">1142</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And may not the same be said of madness and other disorders?
<a name="l1143"><span class="linenum">1143</span></a>        the difference is only that the times are not equal. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1144"><span class="linenum">1144</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1145"><span class="linenum">1145</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And is truth or falsehood to be determined by duration of time?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1146"><span class="linenum">1146</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; That would be in many ways ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1147"><span class="linenum">1147</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But can you certainly determine: by any other means which of
<a name="l1148"><span class="linenum">1148</span></a>        these opinions is true? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1149"><span class="linenum">1149</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I do not think that I can. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1150"><span class="linenum">1150</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Listen, then to a statement of the other side of the argument,
<a name="l1151"><span class="linenum">1151</span></a>        which is made by the champions of appearance. They would say, as I
<a name="l1152"><span class="linenum">1152</span></a>        imagine-can that which is wholly other than something, have the same
<a name="l1153"><span class="linenum">1153</span></a>        quality as that from which it differs? and observe, -&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt;etus, that
<a name="l1154"><span class="linenum">1154</span></a>        the word &amp;quot;other&amp;quot; means not &amp;quot;partially,&amp;quot; but &amp;quot;wholly other.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1155"><span class="linenum">1155</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly, putting the question as you do, that which is wholly
<a name="l1156"><span class="linenum">1156</span></a>        other cannot either potentially or in any other way be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1157"><span class="linenum">1157</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And must therefore be admitted to be unlike? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1158"><span class="linenum">1158</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1159"><span class="linenum">1159</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; If, then, anything happens to become like or unlike itself or
<a name="l1160"><span class="linenum">1160</span></a>        another, when it becomes like we call it the same-when unlike, other?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1161"><span class="linenum">1161</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1162"><span class="linenum">1162</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Were we not saying that there. are agents many and infinite,
<a name="l1163"><span class="linenum">1163</span></a>        and patients many and infinite? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1164"><span class="linenum">1164</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1165"><span class="linenum">1165</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And also that different combinations will produce results which
<a name="l1166"><span class="linenum">1166</span></a>        are not the same, but different? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1167"><span class="linenum">1167</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1168"><span class="linenum">1168</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Let us take you and me, or anything as an example:-There is Socrates
<a name="l1169"><span class="linenum">1169</span></a>        in health, and Socrates sick-Are they like or unlike? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1170"><span class="linenum">1170</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; You mean to, compare Socrates in health as a whole, and Socrates
<a name="l1171"><span class="linenum">1171</span></a>        in sickness as a whole? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1172"><span class="linenum">1172</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Exactly; that is my meaning. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1173"><span class="linenum">1173</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I answer, they are unlike. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1174"><span class="linenum">1174</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And if unlike, they are other? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1175"><span class="linenum">1175</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1176"><span class="linenum">1176</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And would you not say the same of Socrates sleeping and waking,
<a name="l1177"><span class="linenum">1177</span></a>        or in any of the states which we were mentioning? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1178"><span class="linenum">1178</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I should. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1179"><span class="linenum">1179</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; All agents have a different patient in Socrates, accordingly
<a name="l1180"><span class="linenum">1180</span></a>        as he is well or ill. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1181"><span class="linenum">1181</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Of course. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1182"><span class="linenum">1182</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And I who am the patient, and that which is the agent, will produce
<a name="l1183"><span class="linenum">1183</span></a>        something different in each of the two cases? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1184"><span class="linenum">1184</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1185"><span class="linenum">1185</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; The wine which I drink when I am in health, appears sweet and
<a name="l1186"><span class="linenum">1186</span></a>        pleasant to me? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1187"><span class="linenum">1187</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1188"><span class="linenum">1188</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; For, as has been already acknowledged, the patient and agent
<a name="l1189"><span class="linenum">1189</span></a>        meet together and produce sweetness and a perception of sweetness,
<a name="l1190"><span class="linenum">1190</span></a>        which are in simultaneous motion, and the perception which comes from
<a name="l1191"><span class="linenum">1191</span></a>        the patient makes the tongue percipient, and the quality of sweetness
<a name="l1192"><span class="linenum">1192</span></a>        which arises out of and is moving about the wine, makes the wine,
<a name="l1193"><span class="linenum">1193</span></a>        both to be and to appear sweet to the healthy tongue. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1194"><span class="linenum">1194</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly; that has been already acknowledged. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1195"><span class="linenum">1195</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But when I am sick, the wine really acts upon another and a different
<a name="l1196"><span class="linenum">1196</span></a>        person? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1197"><span class="linenum">1197</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1198"><span class="linenum">1198</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; The combination of the draught of wine, and the Socrates who
<a name="l1199"><span class="linenum">1199</span></a>        is sick, produces quite another result; which is the sensation of
<a name="l1200"><span class="linenum">1200</span></a>        bitterness in the tongue, and the, motion and creation of bitterness
<a name="l1201"><span class="linenum">1201</span></a>        in and about the wine, which becomes not bitterness but something
<a name="l1202"><span class="linenum">1202</span></a>        bitter; as I myself become not but percipient? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1203"><span class="linenum">1203</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1204"><span class="linenum">1204</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; There is no, other object of which I shall ever have the same
<a name="l1205"><span class="linenum">1205</span></a>        perception, for another object would give another perception, and
<a name="l1206"><span class="linenum">1206</span></a>        would make the perception other and different; nor can that object
<a name="l1207"><span class="linenum">1207</span></a>        which affects me, meeting another, subject, produce, the same, or
<a name="l1208"><span class="linenum">1208</span></a>        become similar, for that too would produce another result from another
<a name="l1209"><span class="linenum">1209</span></a>        subject, and become different. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1210"><span class="linenum">1210</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1211"><span class="linenum">1211</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Neither can by myself, have this sensation, nor the object by
<a name="l1212"><span class="linenum">1212</span></a>        itself, this quality. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1213"><span class="linenum">1213</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1214"><span class="linenum">1214</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; When I perceive I must become percipient of something-there can
<a name="l1215"><span class="linenum">1215</span></a>        be no such thing as perceiving and perceiving nothing; the object,
<a name="l1216"><span class="linenum">1216</span></a>        whether it become sweet, bitter, or of any other quality, must have
<a name="l1217"><span class="linenum">1217</span></a>        relation to a percipient; nothing can become sweet which is sweet
<a name="l1218"><span class="linenum">1218</span></a>        to no one. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1219"><span class="linenum">1219</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1220"><span class="linenum">1220</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then the inference is, that we [the agent and patient] are or
<a name="l1221"><span class="linenum">1221</span></a>        become in relation to one another; there is a law which binds us one
<a name="l1222"><span class="linenum">1222</span></a>        to the other, but not to any other existence, nor each of us to himself;
<a name="l1223"><span class="linenum">1223</span></a>        and therefore we can only be bound to one another; so that whether
<a name="l1224"><span class="linenum">1224</span></a>        a person says that a thing is or becomes, he must say that it is or
<a name="l1225"><span class="linenum">1225</span></a>        becomes to or of or in relation to something else; but he must not
<a name="l1226"><span class="linenum">1226</span></a>        say or allow any one else to say that anything is or becomes absolutely:
<a name="l1227"><span class="linenum">1227</span></a>        -such is our conclusion. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1228"><span class="linenum">1228</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true, Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1229"><span class="linenum">1229</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then, if that which acts upon me has relation to me and to no
<a name="l1230"><span class="linenum">1230</span></a>        other, I and no other am the percipient of it? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1231"><span class="linenum">1231</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Of course. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1232"><span class="linenum">1232</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then my perception is true to me, being inseparable from my own
<a name="l1233"><span class="linenum">1233</span></a>        being; and, as Protagoras says, to myself I am judge of what is and-what
<a name="l1234"><span class="linenum">1234</span></a>        is not to me. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1235"><span class="linenum">1235</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I suppose so. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1236"><span class="linenum">1236</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; How then, if I never err, and if my mind never trips in the conception
<a name="l1237"><span class="linenum">1237</span></a>        of being or becoming, can I fail of knowing that which I perceive?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1238"><span class="linenum">1238</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; You cannot. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1239"><span class="linenum">1239</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then you were quite right in affirming that knowledge is only
<a name="l1240"><span class="linenum">1240</span></a>        perception; and the meaning turns out to be the same, whether with
<a name="l1241"><span class="linenum">1241</span></a>        Homer and Heracleitus, and all that company, you say that all is motion
<a name="l1242"><span class="linenum">1242</span></a>        and flux, or with the great sage Protagoras, that man is the measure
<a name="l1243"><span class="linenum">1243</span></a>        of all things; or with Theaetetus, that, given these premises, perception
<a name="l1244"><span class="linenum">1244</span></a>        is knowledge. Am I not right, Theaetetus, and is not this your newborn
<a name="l1245"><span class="linenum">1245</span></a>        child, of which I have delivered you? What say you? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1246"><span class="linenum">1246</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I cannot but agree, Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1247"><span class="linenum">1247</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then this is the child, however he may turn out, which you and
<a name="l1248"><span class="linenum">1248</span></a>        I have with difficulty brought into the world. And now that he is
<a name="l1249"><span class="linenum">1249</span></a>        born, we must run round the hearth with him, and see whether he is
<a name="l1250"><span class="linenum">1250</span></a>        worth rearing, or is only a wind-egg and a sham. Is he to be reared
<a name="l1251"><span class="linenum">1251</span></a>        in any case, and not exposed? or will you bear to see him rejected,
<a name="l1252"><span class="linenum">1252</span></a>        and not get into a passion if I take away your first-born?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1253"><span class="linenum">1253</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Theaetetus will not be angry, for he is very good-natured.
<a name="l1254"><span class="linenum">1254</span></a>        But tell me, Socrates, in heaven's name, is this, after all, not the
<a name="l1255"><span class="linenum">1255</span></a>        truth? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1256"><span class="linenum">1256</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; You, Theodorus, are a lover of theories, and now you innocently
<a name="l1257"><span class="linenum">1257</span></a>        fancy that I am a bag full of them, and can easily pull one out which
<a name="l1258"><span class="linenum">1258</span></a>        will overthrow its predecessor. But you do not see that in reality
<a name="l1259"><span class="linenum">1259</span></a>        none of these theories come from me; they all come from him who talks
<a name="l1260"><span class="linenum">1260</span></a>        with me. I only know just enough to extract them from the wisdom of
<a name="l1261"><span class="linenum">1261</span></a>        another, and to receive them in a spirit of fairness. And now I shall
<a name="l1262"><span class="linenum">1262</span></a>        say nothing myself, but shall endeavour to elicit something from our
<a name="l1263"><span class="linenum">1263</span></a>        young friend. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1264"><span class="linenum">1264</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Do as you say, Socrates; you are quite right. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1265"><span class="linenum">1265</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Shall I tell you, Theodorus, what amazes me in your acquaintance
<a name="l1266"><span class="linenum">1266</span></a>        Protagoras? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1267"><span class="linenum">1267</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; What is it? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1268"><span class="linenum">1268</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; I am charmed with his doctrine, that what appears is to each
<a name="l1269"><span class="linenum">1269</span></a>        one, but I wonder that he did not begin his book on Truth with a declaration
<a name="l1270"><span class="linenum">1270</span></a>        that a pig or a dog-faced baboon, or some other yet stranger monster
<a name="l1271"><span class="linenum">1271</span></a>        which has sensation, is the measure of all things; then he might have
<a name="l1272"><span class="linenum">1272</span></a>        shown a magnificent contempt for our opinion of him by informing us
<a name="l1273"><span class="linenum">1273</span></a>        at the outset that while we were reverencing him like a God for his
<a name="l1274"><span class="linenum">1274</span></a>        wisdom he was no better than a tadpole, not to speak of his fellow-men-would
<a name="l1275"><span class="linenum">1275</span></a>        not this have produced an over-powering effect? For if truth is only
<a name="l1276"><span class="linenum">1276</span></a>        sensation, and no man can discern another's feelings better than he,
<a name="l1277"><span class="linenum">1277</span></a>        or has any superior right to determine whether his opinion is true
<a name="l1278"><span class="linenum">1278</span></a>        or false, but each, as we have several times repeated, is to himself
<a name="l1279"><span class="linenum">1279</span></a>        the sole judge, and everything that he judges is true and right, why,
<a name="l1280"><span class="linenum">1280</span></a>        my friend, should Protagoras be preferred to the place of wisdom and
<a name="l1281"><span class="linenum">1281</span></a>        instruction, and deserve to be well paid, and we poor ignoramuses
<a name="l1282"><span class="linenum">1282</span></a>        have to go to him, if each one is the measure of his own wisdom? Must
<a name="l1283"><span class="linenum">1283</span></a>        he not be talking ad captandum in all this? I say nothing of the ridiculous
<a name="l1284"><span class="linenum">1284</span></a>        predicament in which my own midwifery and the whole art of dialectic
<a name="l1285"><span class="linenum">1285</span></a>        is placed; for the attempt to supervise or refute the notions or opinions
<a name="l1286"><span class="linenum">1286</span></a>        of others would be a tedious and enormous piece of folly, if to each
<a name="l1287"><span class="linenum">1287</span></a>        man his own are right; and this must be the case if Protagoras Truth
<a name="l1288"><span class="linenum">1288</span></a>        is the real truth, and the philosopher is not merely amusing himself
<a name="l1289"><span class="linenum">1289</span></a>        by giving oracles out of the shrine of his book. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1290"><span class="linenum">1290</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; He was a friend of mine, Socrates, as you were saying, and
<a name="l1291"><span class="linenum">1291</span></a>        therefore I cannot have him refuted by my lips, nor can I oppose you
<a name="l1292"><span class="linenum">1292</span></a>        when I agree with you; please, then, to take Theaetetus again; he
<a name="l1293"><span class="linenum">1293</span></a>        seemed to answer very nicely. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1294"><span class="linenum">1294</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; If you were to go into a Lacedaemonian palestra, Theodorus, would
<a name="l1295"><span class="linenum">1295</span></a>        you have a right to look on at the naked wrestlers, some of them making
<a name="l1296"><span class="linenum">1296</span></a>        a poor figure, if you did not strip and give them an opportunity of
<a name="l1297"><span class="linenum">1297</span></a>        judging of your own person? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1298"><span class="linenum">1298</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Why not, Socrates, if they would allow me, as I think you will
<a name="l1299"><span class="linenum">1299</span></a>        in consideration of my age and stiffness; let some more supple youth
<a name="l1300"><span class="linenum">1300</span></a>        try a fall with you, and do not drag me into the gymnasium.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1301"><span class="linenum">1301</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Your will is my will, Theodorus, as the proverbial philosophers
<a name="l1302"><span class="linenum">1302</span></a>        say, and therefore I will return to the sage Theaetetus: Tell me,
<a name="l1303"><span class="linenum">1303</span></a>        Theaetetus, in reference to what I was saying, are you not lost in
<a name="l1304"><span class="linenum">1304</span></a>        wonder, like myself, when you find that all of a sudden you are raised
<a name="l1305"><span class="linenum">1305</span></a>        to the level of the wisest of men, or indeed of the gods?-for you
<a name="l1306"><span class="linenum">1306</span></a>        would assume the measure of Protagoras to apply to the gods as well
<a name="l1307"><span class="linenum">1307</span></a>        as men? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1308"><span class="linenum">1308</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly I should, and I confess to you that I am lost in
<a name="l1309"><span class="linenum">1309</span></a>        wonder. At first hearing, I was quite satisfied with the doctrine,
<a name="l1310"><span class="linenum">1310</span></a>        that whatever appears is to each one, but now the face of things has
<a name="l1311"><span class="linenum">1311</span></a>        changed. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1312"><span class="linenum">1312</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Why, my dear boy, you are young, and therefore your ear is quickly
<a name="l1313"><span class="linenum">1313</span></a>        caught and your mind influenced by popular arguments. Protagoras,
<a name="l1314"><span class="linenum">1314</span></a>        or some one speaking on his behalf, will doubtless say in reply, good
<a name="l1315"><span class="linenum">1315</span></a>        people, young and old, you meet and harangue, and bring in the gods,
<a name="l1316"><span class="linenum">1316</span></a>        whose existence of non-existence I banish from writing and speech,
<a name="l1317"><span class="linenum">1317</span></a>        or you talk about the reason of man being degraded to the level of
<a name="l1318"><span class="linenum">1318</span></a>        the brutes, which is a telling argument with the multitude, but not
<a name="l1319"><span class="linenum">1319</span></a>        one word of proof or demonstration do you offer. All is probability
<a name="l1320"><span class="linenum">1320</span></a>        with you, and yet surely you and Theodorus had better reflect whether
<a name="l1321"><span class="linenum">1321</span></a>        you are disposed to admit of probability and figures of speech in
<a name="l1322"><span class="linenum">1322</span></a>        matters of such importance. He or any other mathematician who argued
<a name="l1323"><span class="linenum">1323</span></a>        from probabilities and likelihoods in geometry, would not be worth
<a name="l1324"><span class="linenum">1324</span></a>        an ace. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1325"><span class="linenum">1325</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; But neither you nor we, Socrates, would be satisfied with
<a name="l1326"><span class="linenum">1326</span></a>        such arguments. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1327"><span class="linenum">1327</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then you and Theodorus mean to say that we must look at the matter
<a name="l1328"><span class="linenum">1328</span></a>        in some other way? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1329"><span class="linenum">1329</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, in quite another way. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1330"><span class="linenum">1330</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And the way will be to ask whether perception is or is not the
<a name="l1331"><span class="linenum">1331</span></a>        same as knowledge; for this was the real point of our argument, and
<a name="l1332"><span class="linenum">1332</span></a>        with a view to this we raised (did we not?) those many strange questions.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1333"><span class="linenum">1333</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1334"><span class="linenum">1334</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Shall we say that we know every thing which we see and hear?
<a name="l1335"><span class="linenum">1335</span></a>        for example, shall we say that not having learned, we do not hear
<a name="l1336"><span class="linenum">1336</span></a>        the language of foreigners when they speak to us? or shall we say
<a name="l1337"><span class="linenum">1337</span></a>        that we not only hear, but know what they are saying? Or again, if
<a name="l1338"><span class="linenum">1338</span></a>        we see letters which we do not understand, shall we say that we do
<a name="l1339"><span class="linenum">1339</span></a>        not see them? or shall we aver that, seeing them, we must know them?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1340"><span class="linenum">1340</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; We shall say, Socrates, that we know what we actually see
<a name="l1341"><span class="linenum">1341</span></a>        and hear of them-that is to say, we see and know the figure and colour
<a name="l1342"><span class="linenum">1342</span></a>        of the letters, and we hear and know the elevation or depression of
<a name="l1343"><span class="linenum">1343</span></a>        the sound of them; but we do not perceive by sight and hearing, or
<a name="l1344"><span class="linenum">1344</span></a>        know, that which grammarians and interpreters teach about them.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1345"><span class="linenum">1345</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Capital, Theaetetus; and about this there shall be no dispute,
<a name="l1346"><span class="linenum">1346</span></a>        because I want you to grow; but there is another difficulty coming,
<a name="l1347"><span class="linenum">1347</span></a>        which you will also have to repulse. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1348"><span class="linenum">1348</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; What is it? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1349"><span class="linenum">1349</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Some one will say, Can a man who has ever known anything, and
<a name="l1350"><span class="linenum">1350</span></a>        still has and preserves a memory of that which he knows, not know
<a name="l1351"><span class="linenum">1351</span></a>        that which he remembers at the time when he remembers? I have, I fear,
<a name="l1352"><span class="linenum">1352</span></a>        a tedious way of putting a simple question, which is only, whether
<a name="l1353"><span class="linenum">1353</span></a>        a man who has learned, and remembers, can fail to know? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1354"><span class="linenum">1354</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Impossible, Socrates; the supposition is monstrous.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1355"><span class="linenum">1355</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Am I talking nonsense, then? Think: is not seeing perceiving,
<a name="l1356"><span class="linenum">1356</span></a>        and is not sight perception? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1357"><span class="linenum">1357</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1358"><span class="linenum">1358</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And if our recent definition holds, every man knows that which
<a name="l1359"><span class="linenum">1359</span></a>        he has seen? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1360"><span class="linenum">1360</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1361"><span class="linenum">1361</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And you would admit that there is such a thing as memory?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1362"><span class="linenum">1362</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1363"><span class="linenum">1363</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And is memory of something or of nothing? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1364"><span class="linenum">1364</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Of something, surely. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1365"><span class="linenum">1365</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Of things learned and perceived, that is? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1366"><span class="linenum">1366</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1367"><span class="linenum">1367</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Often a man remembers that which he has seen? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1368"><span class="linenum">1368</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1369"><span class="linenum">1369</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And if he closed his eyes, would he forget? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1370"><span class="linenum">1370</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Who, Socrates, would dare to say so? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1371"><span class="linenum">1371</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But we must say so, if the previous argument is to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1372"><span class="linenum">1372</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; What do you mean? I am not quite sure that I understand you,
<a name="l1373"><span class="linenum">1373</span></a>        though I have a strong suspicion that you are right. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1374"><span class="linenum">1374</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; As thus: he who sees knows, as we say, that which he sees; for
<a name="l1375"><span class="linenum">1375</span></a>        perception and sight and knowledge are admitted to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1376"><span class="linenum">1376</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1377"><span class="linenum">1377</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But he who saw, and has knowledge of that which he saw, remembers,
<a name="l1378"><span class="linenum">1378</span></a>        when he closes his eyes, that which he no longer sees. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1379"><span class="linenum">1379</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1380"><span class="linenum">1380</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And seeing is knowing, and therefore not-seeing is not-knowing?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1381"><span class="linenum">1381</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1382"><span class="linenum">1382</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then the inference is, that a man may have attained the knowledge,
<a name="l1383"><span class="linenum">1383</span></a>        of something, which he may remember and yet not know, because he does
<a name="l1384"><span class="linenum">1384</span></a>        not see; and this has been affirmed by us to be a monstrous supposition.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1385"><span class="linenum">1385</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Most true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1386"><span class="linenum">1386</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Thus, then, the assertion that knowledge and perception are one,
<a name="l1387"><span class="linenum">1387</span></a>        involves a manifest impossibility? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1388"><span class="linenum">1388</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1389"><span class="linenum">1389</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then they must be distinguished? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1390"><span class="linenum">1390</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I suppose that they must. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1391"><span class="linenum">1391</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Once more we shall have to begin, and ask &amp;quot;What is knowledge?&amp;quot;
<a name="l1392"><span class="linenum">1392</span></a>        and yet, Theaetetus, what are we going to do? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1393"><span class="linenum">1393</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; About what? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1394"><span class="linenum">1394</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Like a good-for-nothing cock, without having won the victory,
<a name="l1395"><span class="linenum">1395</span></a>        we walk away from the argument and crow. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1396"><span class="linenum">1396</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; How do you mean? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1397"><span class="linenum">1397</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; After the manner of disputers, we were satisfied with mere verbal
<a name="l1398"><span class="linenum">1398</span></a>        consistency, and were well pleased if in this way we could gain an
<a name="l1399"><span class="linenum">1399</span></a>        advantage. Although professing not to be mere Eristics, but philosophers,
<a name="l1400"><span class="linenum">1400</span></a>        I suspect that we have unconsciously fallen into the error of that
<a name="l1401"><span class="linenum">1401</span></a>        ingenious class of persons. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1402"><span class="linenum">1402</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I do not as yet understand you. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1403"><span class="linenum">1403</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then I will try to explain myself: just now we asked the question,
<a name="l1404"><span class="linenum">1404</span></a>        whether a man who had learned and remembered could fail to know, and
<a name="l1405"><span class="linenum">1405</span></a>        we showed that a person who had seen might remember when he had his
<a name="l1406"><span class="linenum">1406</span></a>        eyes shut and could not see, and then he would at the same time remember
<a name="l1407"><span class="linenum">1407</span></a>        and not know. But this was an impossibility. And so the Protagorean
<a name="l1408"><span class="linenum">1408</span></a>        fable came to nought, and yours also, who maintained that knowledge
<a name="l1409"><span class="linenum">1409</span></a>        is the same as perception. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1410"><span class="linenum">1410</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1411"><span class="linenum">1411</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And yet, my friend, I rather suspect that the result would have
<a name="l1412"><span class="linenum">1412</span></a>        been different if Protagoras, who was the father of the first of the
<a name="l1413"><span class="linenum">1413</span></a>        two-brats, had been alive; he would have had a great deal to say on
<a name="l1414"><span class="linenum">1414</span></a>        their behalf. But he is dead, and we insult over his orphan child;
<a name="l1415"><span class="linenum">1415</span></a>        and even the guardians whom he left, and of whom our friend Theodorus
<a name="l1416"><span class="linenum">1416</span></a>        is one, are unwilling to give any help, and therefore I suppose that
<a name="l1417"><span class="linenum">1417</span></a>        must take up his cause myself, and see justice done? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1418"><span class="linenum">1418</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Not I, Socrates, but rather Callias, the son of Hipponicus,
<a name="l1419"><span class="linenum">1419</span></a>        is guardian of his orphans. I was too soon diverted from the abstractions
<a name="l1420"><span class="linenum">1420</span></a>        of dialectic to geometry. Nevertheless, I shall be grateful to you
<a name="l1421"><span class="linenum">1421</span></a>        if you assist him. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1422"><span class="linenum">1422</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Very good, Theodorus; you shall see how I will come to the rescue.
<a name="l1423"><span class="linenum">1423</span></a>        If a person does not attend to the meaning of terms as they are commonly
<a name="l1424"><span class="linenum">1424</span></a>        used in argument, he may be involved even in greater paradoxes than
<a name="l1425"><span class="linenum">1425</span></a>        these. Shall I explain this matter to you or to Theaetetus?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1426"><span class="linenum">1426</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; To both of us, and let the younger answer; he will incur less
<a name="l1427"><span class="linenum">1427</span></a>        disgrace if he is discomfited. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1428"><span class="linenum">1428</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then now let me ask the awful question, which is this:-Can a
<a name="l1429"><span class="linenum">1429</span></a>        man know and also not know that which he knows? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1430"><span class="linenum">1430</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; How shall we answer, Theaetetus? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1431"><span class="linenum">1431</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; He cannot, I should say. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1432"><span class="linenum">1432</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; He can, if you maintain that seeing is knowing. When you are
<a name="l1433"><span class="linenum">1433</span></a>        imprisoned in a well, as the saying is, and the self-assured adversary
<a name="l1434"><span class="linenum">1434</span></a>        closes one of your eyes with his hand, and asks whether you can see
<a name="l1435"><span class="linenum">1435</span></a>        his cloak with the eye which he has closed, how will you answer the
<a name="l1436"><span class="linenum">1436</span></a>        inevitable man? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1437"><span class="linenum">1437</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; I should answer, &amp;quot;Not with that eye but with the other.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1438"><span class="linenum">1438</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then you see and do not see the same thing at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1439"><span class="linenum">1439</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, in a certain sense. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1440"><span class="linenum">1440</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; None of that, he will reply; I do not ask or bid you answer in
<a name="l1441"><span class="linenum">1441</span></a>        what sense you know, but only whether you know that which you do not
<a name="l1442"><span class="linenum">1442</span></a>        know. You have been proved to see that which you do not see; and you
<a name="l1443"><span class="linenum">1443</span></a>        have already admitted that seeing is knowing, and that not-seeing
<a name="l1444"><span class="linenum">1444</span></a>        is not-knowing: I leave you to draw the inference. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1445"><span class="linenum">1445</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, the inference is the contradictory of my assertion.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1446"><span class="linenum">1446</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, my marvel, and there might have been yet worse things in
<a name="l1447"><span class="linenum">1447</span></a>        store for you, if an opponent had gone on to ask whether you can have
<a name="l1448"><span class="linenum">1448</span></a>        a sharp and also a dull knowledge, and whether you can know near,
<a name="l1449"><span class="linenum">1449</span></a>        but not at a distance, or know the same thing with more or less intensity,
<a name="l1450"><span class="linenum">1450</span></a>        and so on without end. Such questions might have been put to you by
<a name="l1451"><span class="linenum">1451</span></a>        a light-armed mercenary, who argued for pay. He would have lain in
<a name="l1452"><span class="linenum">1452</span></a>        wait for you, and when you took up the position, that sense is knowledge,
<a name="l1453"><span class="linenum">1453</span></a>        he would have made an assault upon hearing, smelling, and the other
<a name="l1454"><span class="linenum">1454</span></a>        senses;-he would have shown you no mercy; and while you were lost
<a name="l1455"><span class="linenum">1455</span></a>        in envy and admiration of his wisdom, he would have got you into his
<a name="l1456"><span class="linenum">1456</span></a>        net, out of which you would not have escaped until you had come to
<a name="l1457"><span class="linenum">1457</span></a>        an understanding about the sum to be paid for your release. Well,
<a name="l1458"><span class="linenum">1458</span></a>        you ask, and how will Protagoras reinforce his position? Shall I answer
<a name="l1459"><span class="linenum">1459</span></a>        for him? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1460"><span class="linenum">1460</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; By all means. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1461"><span class="linenum">1461</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; He will repeat all those things which we have been urging on
<a name="l1462"><span class="linenum">1462</span></a>        his behalf, and then he will close with us in disdain, and say:-The
<a name="l1463"><span class="linenum">1463</span></a>        worthy Socrates asked a little boy, whether the same man could remember
<a name="l1464"><span class="linenum">1464</span></a>        and not know the same thing, and the boy said No, because he was frightened,
<a name="l1465"><span class="linenum">1465</span></a>        and could not see what was coming, and then Socrates made fun of poor
<a name="l1466"><span class="linenum">1466</span></a>        me. The truth is, O slatternly Socrates, that when you ask questions
<a name="l1467"><span class="linenum">1467</span></a>        about any assertion of mine, and the person asked is found tripping,
<a name="l1468"><span class="linenum">1468</span></a>        if he has answered as I should have answered, then I am refuted, but
<a name="l1469"><span class="linenum">1469</span></a>        if he answers something else, then he is refuted and not I. For do
<a name="l1470"><span class="linenum">1470</span></a>        you really suppose that any one would admit the memory which a man
<a name="l1471"><span class="linenum">1471</span></a>        has of an impression which has passed away to be the same with that
<a name="l1472"><span class="linenum">1472</span></a>        which he experienced at the time? Assuredly not. Or would he hesitate
<a name="l1473"><span class="linenum">1473</span></a>        to acknowledge that the same man may know and not know the same thing?
<a name="l1474"><span class="linenum">1474</span></a>        Or, if he is afraid of making this admission, would he ever grant
<a name="l1475"><span class="linenum">1475</span></a>        that one who has become unlike is the same as before he became unlike?
<a name="l1476"><span class="linenum">1476</span></a>        Or would he admit that a man is one at all, and not rather many and
<a name="l1477"><span class="linenum">1477</span></a>        infinite as the changes which take place in him? I speak by the card
<a name="l1478"><span class="linenum">1478</span></a>        in order to avoid entanglements of words. But, O my good sir, he would
<a name="l1479"><span class="linenum">1479</span></a>        say, come to the argument in a more generous spirit; and either show,
<a name="l1480"><span class="linenum">1480</span></a>        if you can, that our sensations are not relative and individual, or,
<a name="l1481"><span class="linenum">1481</span></a>        if you admit them to be so, prove that this does not involve the consequence
<a name="l1482"><span class="linenum">1482</span></a>        that the appearance becomes, or, if you will have the word, is, to
<a name="l1483"><span class="linenum">1483</span></a>        the individual only. As to your talk about pigs and baboons, you are
<a name="l1484"><span class="linenum">1484</span></a>        yourself behaving like a pig, and you teach your hearers to make sport
<a name="l1485"><span class="linenum">1485</span></a>        of my writings in the same ignorant manner; but this is not to your
<a name="l1486"><span class="linenum">1486</span></a>        credit. For I declare that the truth is as I have written, and that
<a name="l1487"><span class="linenum">1487</span></a>        each of us is a measure of existence and of non-existence. Yet one
<a name="l1488"><span class="linenum">1488</span></a>        man may be a thousand times better than another in proportion as different
<a name="l1489"><span class="linenum">1489</span></a>        things are and appear to him. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1490"><span class="linenum">1490</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;And I am far from saying that wisdom and the wise man have no existence;
<a name="l1491"><span class="linenum">1491</span></a>        but I say that the wise man is he who makes the evils which appear
<a name="l1492"><span class="linenum">1492</span></a>        and are to a man, into goods which are and appear to him. And I would
<a name="l1493"><span class="linenum">1493</span></a>        beg you not to my words in the letter, but to take the meaning of
<a name="l1494"><span class="linenum">1494</span></a>        them as I will explain them. Remember what has been already said,-that
<a name="l1495"><span class="linenum">1495</span></a>        to the sick man his food appears to be and is bitter, and to the man
<a name="l1496"><span class="linenum">1496</span></a>        in health the opposite of bitter. Now I cannot conceive that one of
<a name="l1497"><span class="linenum">1497</span></a>        these men can be or ought to be made wiser than the other: nor can
<a name="l1498"><span class="linenum">1498</span></a>        you assert that the sick man because he has one impression is foolish,
<a name="l1499"><span class="linenum">1499</span></a>        and the healthy man because he has another is wise; but the one state
<a name="l1500"><span class="linenum">1500</span></a>        requires to be changed into the other, the worse into the better.
<a name="l1501"><span class="linenum">1501</span></a>        As in education, a change of state has to be effected, and the sophist
<a name="l1502"><span class="linenum">1502</span></a>        accomplishes by words the change which the physician works by the
<a name="l1503"><span class="linenum">1503</span></a>        aid of drugs. Not that any one ever made another think truly, who
<a name="l1504"><span class="linenum">1504</span></a>        previously thought falsely. For no one can think what is not, or think
<a name="l1505"><span class="linenum">1505</span></a>        anything different from that which he feels; and this is always true.
<a name="l1506"><span class="linenum">1506</span></a>        But as the inferior habit of mind has thoughts of kindred nature,
<a name="l1507"><span class="linenum">1507</span></a>        so I conceive that a good mind causes men to have good thoughts; and
<a name="l1508"><span class="linenum">1508</span></a>        these which the inexperienced call true, I maintain to be only better,
<a name="l1509"><span class="linenum">1509</span></a>        and not truer than others. And, O my dear Socrates, I do not call
<a name="l1510"><span class="linenum">1510</span></a>        wise men tadpoles: far from it; I say that they are the physicians
<a name="l1511"><span class="linenum">1511</span></a>        of the human body, and the husbandmen of plants-for the husbandmen
<a name="l1512"><span class="linenum">1512</span></a>        also take away the evil and disordered sensations of plants, and infuse
<a name="l1513"><span class="linenum">1513</span></a>        into them good and healthy sensations-aye and true ones; and the wise
<a name="l1514"><span class="linenum">1514</span></a>        and good rhetoricians make the good instead of the evil to seem just
<a name="l1515"><span class="linenum">1515</span></a>        to states; for whatever appears to a state to be just and fair, so
<a name="l1516"><span class="linenum">1516</span></a>        long as it is regarded as such, is just and fair to it; but the teacher
<a name="l1517"><span class="linenum">1517</span></a>        of wisdom causes the good to take the place of the evil, both in appearance
<a name="l1518"><span class="linenum">1518</span></a>        and in reality. And in like manner the Sophist who is able to train
<a name="l1519"><span class="linenum">1519</span></a>        his pupils in this spirit is a wise man, and deserves to be well paid
<a name="l1520"><span class="linenum">1520</span></a>        by them. And so one man is wiser than another; and no one thinks falsely,
<a name="l1521"><span class="linenum">1521</span></a>        and you, whether you will or not, must endure to be a measure. On
<a name="l1522"><span class="linenum">1522</span></a>        these foundations the argument stands firm, which you, Socrates, may,
<a name="l1523"><span class="linenum">1523</span></a>        if you please, overthrow by an opposite argument, or if you like you
<a name="l1524"><span class="linenum">1524</span></a>        may put questions to me-a method to which no intelligent person will
<a name="l1525"><span class="linenum">1525</span></a>        object, quite the reverse. But I must beg you to put fair questions:
<a name="l1526"><span class="linenum">1526</span></a>        for there is great inconsistency in saying that you have a zeal for
<a name="l1527"><span class="linenum">1527</span></a>        virtue, and then always behaving unfairly in argument. The unfairness
<a name="l1528"><span class="linenum">1528</span></a>        of which I complain is that you do not distinguish between mere disputation
<a name="l1529"><span class="linenum">1529</span></a>        and dialectic: the disputer may trip up his opponent as often as he
<a name="l1530"><span class="linenum">1530</span></a>        likes, and make fun; but the dialectician will be in earnest, and
<a name="l1531"><span class="linenum">1531</span></a>        only correct his adversary when necessary, telling him the errors
<a name="l1532"><span class="linenum">1532</span></a>        into which he has fallen through his own fault, or that of the company
<a name="l1533"><span class="linenum">1533</span></a>        which he has previously kept. If you do so, your adversary will lay
<a name="l1534"><span class="linenum">1534</span></a>        the blame of his own confusion and perplexity on himself, and not
<a name="l1535"><span class="linenum">1535</span></a>        on you; will follow and love you, and will hate himself, and escape
<a name="l1536"><span class="linenum">1536</span></a>        from himself into philosophy, in order that he may become different
<a name="l1537"><span class="linenum">1537</span></a>        from what he was. But the other mode of arguing, which is practised
<a name="l1538"><span class="linenum">1538</span></a>        by the many, will have just the opposite effect upon him; and as he
<a name="l1539"><span class="linenum">1539</span></a>        grows older, instead of turning philosopher, he will come to hate
<a name="l1540"><span class="linenum">1540</span></a>        philosophy. I would recommend you, therefore, as I said before, not
<a name="l1541"><span class="linenum">1541</span></a>        to encourage yourself in this polemical and controversial temper,
<a name="l1542"><span class="linenum">1542</span></a>        but to find out, in a friendly and congenial spirit, what we really
<a name="l1543"><span class="linenum">1543</span></a>        mean when we say that all things are in motion, and that to every
<a name="l1544"><span class="linenum">1544</span></a>        individual and state what appears, is. In this manner you will consider
<a name="l1545"><span class="linenum">1545</span></a>        whether knowledge and sensation are the same or different, but you
<a name="l1546"><span class="linenum">1546</span></a>        will not argue, as you were just now doing, from the customary use
<a name="l1547"><span class="linenum">1547</span></a>        of names and words, which the vulgar pervert in all sorts of ways,
<a name="l1548"><span class="linenum">1548</span></a>        causing infinite perplexity to one another. Such, Theodorus, is the
<a name="l1549"><span class="linenum">1549</span></a>        very slight help which I am able to offer to your old friend; had
<a name="l1550"><span class="linenum">1550</span></a>        he been living, he would have helped himself in a far more gloriose
<a name="l1551"><span class="linenum">1551</span></a>        style. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1552"><span class="linenum">1552</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; You are jesting, Socrates; indeed, your defence of him has
<a name="l1553"><span class="linenum">1553</span></a>        been most valorous. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1554"><span class="linenum">1554</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Thank you, friend; and I hope that you observed Protagoras bidding
<a name="l1555"><span class="linenum">1555</span></a>        us be serious, as the text, &amp;quot;Man is the measure of all things,&amp;quot; was
<a name="l1556"><span class="linenum">1556</span></a>        a solemn one; and he reproached us with making a boy the medium of
<a name="l1557"><span class="linenum">1557</span></a>        discourse, and said that the boy's timidity was made to tell against
<a name="l1558"><span class="linenum">1558</span></a>        his argument; he also declared that we made a joke of him.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1559"><span class="linenum">1559</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; How could I fail to observe all that, Socrates? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1560"><span class="linenum">1560</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Well, and shall we do as he says? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1561"><span class="linenum">1561</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; By all means. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1562"><span class="linenum">1562</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But if his wishes are to be regarded, you and I must take up
<a name="l1563"><span class="linenum">1563</span></a>        the argument, and in all seriousness, and ask and answer one another,
<a name="l1564"><span class="linenum">1564</span></a>        for you see that the rest of us are nothing but boys. In no other
<a name="l1565"><span class="linenum">1565</span></a>        way can we escape the imputation, that in our fresh analysis of his
<a name="l1566"><span class="linenum">1566</span></a>        thesis we are making fun with boys. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1567"><span class="linenum">1567</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Well, but is not Theaetetus better able to follow a philosophical
<a name="l1568"><span class="linenum">1568</span></a>        enquiry than a great many men who have long beards? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1569"><span class="linenum">1569</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, Theodorus, but not better than you; and therefore please
<a name="l1570"><span class="linenum">1570</span></a>        not to imagine that I am to defend by every means in my power your
<a name="l1571"><span class="linenum">1571</span></a>        departed friend; and that you are to defend nothing and nobody. At
<a name="l1572"><span class="linenum">1572</span></a>        any rate, my good man, do not sheer off until we know whether you
<a name="l1573"><span class="linenum">1573</span></a>        are a true measure of diagrams, or whether all men are equally measures
<a name="l1574"><span class="linenum">1574</span></a>        and sufficient for themselves in astronomy and geometry, and the other
<a name="l1575"><span class="linenum">1575</span></a>        branches of knowledge in which you are supposed to excel them.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1576"><span class="linenum">1576</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; He who is sitting by you, Socrates, will not easily avoid being
<a name="l1577"><span class="linenum">1577</span></a>        drawn into an argument; and when I said just now that you would excuse
<a name="l1578"><span class="linenum">1578</span></a>        me, and not, like the Lacedaemonians, compel me to strip and fight,
<a name="l1579"><span class="linenum">1579</span></a>        I was talking nonsense-I should rather compare you to Scirrhon, who
<a name="l1580"><span class="linenum">1580</span></a>        threw travellers from the rocks; for the Lacedaemonian rule is &amp;quot;strip
<a name="l1581"><span class="linenum">1581</span></a>        or depart,&amp;quot; but you seem to go about your work more after the fashion
<a name="l1582"><span class="linenum">1582</span></a>        of Antaeus: you will not allow any one who approaches you to depart
<a name="l1583"><span class="linenum">1583</span></a>        until you have stripped him, and he has been compelled to try a fall
<a name="l1584"><span class="linenum">1584</span></a>        with you in argument. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1585"><span class="linenum">1585</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; There, Theodorus, you have hit off precisely the nature of my
<a name="l1586"><span class="linenum">1586</span></a>        complaint; but I am even more pugnacious than the giants of old, for
<a name="l1587"><span class="linenum">1587</span></a>        I have met with no end of heroes; many a Heracles, many a Theseus,
<a name="l1588"><span class="linenum">1588</span></a>        mighty in words, has broken my head; nevertheless I am always at this
<a name="l1589"><span class="linenum">1589</span></a>        rough exercise, which inspires me like a passion. Please, then, to
<a name="l1590"><span class="linenum">1590</span></a>        try a fall with me, whereby you will do yourself good as well as me.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1591"><span class="linenum">1591</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; I consent; lead me whither you will, for I know that you are
<a name="l1592"><span class="linenum">1592</span></a>        like destiny; no man can escape from any argument which you may weave
<a name="l1593"><span class="linenum">1593</span></a>        for him. But I am not disposed to go further than you suggest.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1594"><span class="linenum">1594</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Once will be enough; and now take particular care that we do
<a name="l1595"><span class="linenum">1595</span></a>        not again unwittingly expose ourselves to the reproach of talking
<a name="l1596"><span class="linenum">1596</span></a>        childishly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1597"><span class="linenum">1597</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; I will do my best to avoid that error. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1598"><span class="linenum">1598</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; In the first place, let us return to our old objection, and see
<a name="l1599"><span class="linenum">1599</span></a>        whether we were right in blaming and taking offence at Protagoras
<a name="l1600"><span class="linenum">1600</span></a>        on the ground that he assumed all to be equal and sufficient in wisdom;
<a name="l1601"><span class="linenum">1601</span></a>        although he admitted that there was a better and worse, and that in
<a name="l1602"><span class="linenum">1602</span></a>        respect of this, some who as he said were the wise excelled others.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1603"><span class="linenum">1603</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1604"><span class="linenum">1604</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Had Protagoras been living and answered for himself, instead
<a name="l1605"><span class="linenum">1605</span></a>        of our answering for him, there would have been no need of our reviewing
<a name="l1606"><span class="linenum">1606</span></a>        or reinforcing the argument. But as he is not here, and some one may
<a name="l1607"><span class="linenum">1607</span></a>        accuse us of speaking without authority on his behalf, had we not
<a name="l1608"><span class="linenum">1608</span></a>        better come to a clearer agreement about his meaning, for a great
<a name="l1609"><span class="linenum">1609</span></a>        deal may be at stake? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1610"><span class="linenum">1610</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; True. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1611"><span class="linenum">1611</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then let us obtain, not through any third person, but from his
<a name="l1612"><span class="linenum">1612</span></a>        own statement and in the fewest words possible, the basis of agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1613"><span class="linenum">1613</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; In what way? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1614"><span class="linenum">1614</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; In this way:-His words are, &amp;quot;What seems to a man, is to him.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1615"><span class="linenum">1615</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, so he says. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1616"><span class="linenum">1616</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And are not we, Protagoras, uttering the opinion of man, or rather
<a name="l1617"><span class="linenum">1617</span></a>        of all mankind, when we say that every one thinks himself wiser than
<a name="l1618"><span class="linenum">1618</span></a>        other men in some things, and their inferior in others? In the hour
<a name="l1619"><span class="linenum">1619</span></a>        of danger, when they are in perils of war, or of the sea, or of sickness,
<a name="l1620"><span class="linenum">1620</span></a>        do they not look up to their commanders as if they were gods, and
<a name="l1621"><span class="linenum">1621</span></a>        expect salvation from them, only because they excel them in knowledge?
<a name="l1622"><span class="linenum">1622</span></a>        Is not the world full of men in their several employments, who are
<a name="l1623"><span class="linenum">1623</span></a>        looking for teachers and rulers of themselves and of the animals?
<a name="l1624"><span class="linenum">1624</span></a>        and there are plenty who think that they are able to teach and able
<a name="l1625"><span class="linenum">1625</span></a>        to rule. Now, in all this is implied that ignorance and wisdom exist
<a name="l1626"><span class="linenum">1626</span></a>        among them, least in their own opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1627"><span class="linenum">1627</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1628"><span class="linenum">1628</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And wisdom is assumed by them to be true thought, and ignorance
<a name="l1629"><span class="linenum">1629</span></a>        to be false opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1630"><span class="linenum">1630</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Exactly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1631"><span class="linenum">1631</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; How then, Protagoras, would you have us treat the argument? Shall
<a name="l1632"><span class="linenum">1632</span></a>        we say that the opinions of men are always true, or sometimes true
<a name="l1633"><span class="linenum">1633</span></a>        and sometimes false? In either case, the result is the same, and their
<a name="l1634"><span class="linenum">1634</span></a>        opinions are not always true, but sometimes true and sometimes false.
<a name="l1635"><span class="linenum">1635</span></a>        For tell me, Theodorus, do you suppose that you yourself, or any other
<a name="l1636"><span class="linenum">1636</span></a>        follower of Protagoras, would contend that no one deems another ignorant
<a name="l1637"><span class="linenum">1637</span></a>        or mistaken in his opinion? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1638"><span class="linenum">1638</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; The thing is incredible, Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1639"><span class="linenum">1639</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And yet that absurdity is necessarily involved in the thesis
<a name="l1640"><span class="linenum">1640</span></a>        which declares man to be the measure of all things. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1641"><span class="linenum">1641</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; How so? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1642"><span class="linenum">1642</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Why, suppose that you determine in your own mind something to
<a name="l1643"><span class="linenum">1643</span></a>        be true, and declare your opinion to me; let us assume, as he argues,
<a name="l1644"><span class="linenum">1644</span></a>        that this is true to you. Now, if so, you must either say that the
<a name="l1645"><span class="linenum">1645</span></a>        rest of us are not the judges of this opinion or judgment of yours,
<a name="l1646"><span class="linenum">1646</span></a>        or that we judge you always to have a true opinion: But are there
<a name="l1647"><span class="linenum">1647</span></a>        not thousands upon thousands who, whenever you form a judgment, take
<a name="l1648"><span class="linenum">1648</span></a>        up arms against you and are of an opposite judgment and opinion, deeming
<a name="l1649"><span class="linenum">1649</span></a>        that you judge falsely? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1650"><span class="linenum">1650</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, indeed, Socrates, thousands and tens of thousands, as
<a name="l1651"><span class="linenum">1651</span></a>        Homer says, who give me a world of trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1652"><span class="linenum">1652</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Well, but are we to assert that what you think is true to you
<a name="l1653"><span class="linenum">1653</span></a>        and false to the ten thousand others? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1654"><span class="linenum">1654</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; No other inference seems to be possible. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1655"><span class="linenum">1655</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And how about Protagoras himself? If neither he nor the multitude
<a name="l1656"><span class="linenum">1656</span></a>        thought, as indeed they do not think, that man is the measure of all
<a name="l1657"><span class="linenum">1657</span></a>        things, must it not follow that the truth of which Protagoras wrote
<a name="l1658"><span class="linenum">1658</span></a>        would be true to no one? But if you suppose that he himself thought
<a name="l1659"><span class="linenum">1659</span></a>        this, and that the multitude does not agree with him, you must begin
<a name="l1660"><span class="linenum">1660</span></a>        by allowing that in whatever proportion the many are more than one,
<a name="l1661"><span class="linenum">1661</span></a>        in that proportion his truth is more untrue than true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1662"><span class="linenum">1662</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; That would follow if the truth is supposed to vary with individual
<a name="l1663"><span class="linenum">1663</span></a>        opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1664"><span class="linenum">1664</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And the best of the joke is, that he acknowledges the truth of
<a name="l1665"><span class="linenum">1665</span></a>        their opinion who believe his own opinion to be false; for he admits
<a name="l1666"><span class="linenum">1666</span></a>        that the opinions of all men are true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1667"><span class="linenum">1667</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1668"><span class="linenum">1668</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And does he not allow that his own opinion is false, if he admits
<a name="l1669"><span class="linenum">1669</span></a>        that the opinion of those who think him false is true? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1670"><span class="linenum">1670</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Of course. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1671"><span class="linenum">1671</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Whereas the other side do not admit that they speak falsely?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1672"><span class="linenum">1672</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; They do not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1673"><span class="linenum">1673</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And he, as may be inferred from his writings, agrees that this
<a name="l1674"><span class="linenum">1674</span></a>        opinion is also true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1675"><span class="linenum">1675</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Clearly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1676"><span class="linenum">1676</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then all mankind, beginning with Protagoras, will contend, or
<a name="l1677"><span class="linenum">1677</span></a>        rather, I should say that he will allow, when he concedes that his
<a name="l1678"><span class="linenum">1678</span></a>        adversary has a true opinion-Protagoras, I say, will himself allow
<a name="l1679"><span class="linenum">1679</span></a>        that neither a dog nor any ordinary man is the measure of anything
<a name="l1680"><span class="linenum">1680</span></a>        which he has not learned-am I not right? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1681"><span class="linenum">1681</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1682"><span class="linenum">1682</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And the truth of Protagoras being doubted by all, will be true
<a name="l1683"><span class="linenum">1683</span></a>        neither to himself to any one else? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1684"><span class="linenum">1684</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; I think, Socrates, that we are running my old friend too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1685"><span class="linenum">1685</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But do not know that we are going beyond the truth. Doubtless,
<a name="l1686"><span class="linenum">1686</span></a>        as he is older, he may be expected to be wiser than we are. And if
<a name="l1687"><span class="linenum">1687</span></a>        he could only just get his head out of the world below, he would have
<a name="l1688"><span class="linenum">1688</span></a>        overthrown both of us again and again, me for talking nonsense and
<a name="l1689"><span class="linenum">1689</span></a>        you for assenting to me, and have been off and underground in a trice.
<a name="l1690"><span class="linenum">1690</span></a>        But as he is not within call, we must make the best use of our own
<a name="l1691"><span class="linenum">1691</span></a>        faculties, such as they are, and speak out what appears to us to be
<a name="l1692"><span class="linenum">1692</span></a>        true. And one thing which no one will deny is, that there are great
<a name="l1693"><span class="linenum">1693</span></a>        differences in the understandings of men. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1694"><span class="linenum">1694</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; In that opinion I quite agree. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1695"><span class="linenum">1695</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And is there not most likely to be firm ground in the distinction
<a name="l1696"><span class="linenum">1696</span></a>        which we were indicating on behalf of Protagoras, viz., that most
<a name="l1697"><span class="linenum">1697</span></a>        things, and all immediate sensations, such as hot, dry, sweet, are
<a name="l1698"><span class="linenum">1698</span></a>        only such as they appear; if however difference of opinion is to be
<a name="l1699"><span class="linenum">1699</span></a>        allowed at all, surely we must allow it in respect of health or disease?
<a name="l1700"><span class="linenum">1700</span></a>        for every woman, child, or living creature has not such a knowledge
<a name="l1701"><span class="linenum">1701</span></a>        of what conduces to health as to enable them to cure themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1702"><span class="linenum">1702</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; I quite agree. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1703"><span class="linenum">1703</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Or again, in politics, while affirming that just and unjust,
<a name="l1704"><span class="linenum">1704</span></a>        honourable and disgraceful, holy and unholy, are in reality to each
<a name="l1705"><span class="linenum">1705</span></a>        state such as the state thinks and makes lawful, and that in determining
<a name="l1706"><span class="linenum">1706</span></a>        these matters no individual or state is wiser than another, still
<a name="l1707"><span class="linenum">1707</span></a>        the followers of Protagoras will not deny that in determining what
<a name="l1708"><span class="linenum">1708</span></a>        is or is not expedient for the community one state is wiser and one
<a name="l1709"><span class="linenum">1709</span></a>        counsellor better that another-they will scarcely venture to maintain,
<a name="l1710"><span class="linenum">1710</span></a>        that what a city enacts in the belief that it is expedient will always
<a name="l1711"><span class="linenum">1711</span></a>        be really expedient. But in the other case, I mean when they speak
<a name="l1712"><span class="linenum">1712</span></a>        of justice and injustice, piety and impiety, they are confident that
<a name="l1713"><span class="linenum">1713</span></a>        in nature these have no existence or essence of their own-the truth
<a name="l1714"><span class="linenum">1714</span></a>        is that which is agreed on at the time of the agreement, and as long
<a name="l1715"><span class="linenum">1715</span></a>        as the agreement lasts; and this is the philosophy of many who do
<a name="l1716"><span class="linenum">1716</span></a>        not altogether go along with Protagoras. Here arises a new question,
<a name="l1717"><span class="linenum">1717</span></a>        Theodorus, which threatens to be more serious than the last.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1718"><span class="linenum">1718</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Well, Socrates, we have plenty of leisure. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1719"><span class="linenum">1719</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; That is true, and your remark recalls to my mind an observation
<a name="l1720"><span class="linenum">1720</span></a>        which I have often made, that those who have passed their days in
<a name="l1721"><span class="linenum">1721</span></a>        the pursuit of philosophy are ridiculously at fault when they have
<a name="l1722"><span class="linenum">1722</span></a>        to appear and speak in court. How natural is this! &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1723"><span class="linenum">1723</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; What do you mean? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1724"><span class="linenum">1724</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; I mean to say, that those who have been trained in philosophy
<a name="l1725"><span class="linenum">1725</span></a>        and liberal pursuits are as unlike those who from their youth upwards
<a name="l1726"><span class="linenum">1726</span></a>        have been knocking about in the courts and such places, as a freeman
<a name="l1727"><span class="linenum">1727</span></a>        is in breeding unlike a slave. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1728"><span class="linenum">1728</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; In what is the difference seen? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1729"><span class="linenum">1729</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; In the leisure spoken of by you, which a freeman can always command:
<a name="l1730"><span class="linenum">1730</span></a>        he has his talk, out in peace, and, like ourselves, he wanders at
<a name="l1731"><span class="linenum">1731</span></a>        will from one subject to another, and from a second to a third,-if
<a name="l1732"><span class="linenum">1732</span></a>        the fancy takes him he begins again, as we are doing now, caring not
<a name="l1733"><span class="linenum">1733</span></a>        whether his words are many or few; his only aim is to attain the truth.
<a name="l1734"><span class="linenum">1734</span></a>        But the lawyer is always in a hurry; there is the water of the clepsydra
<a name="l1735"><span class="linenum">1735</span></a>        driving him on, and not allowing him to expatiate at will: and there
<a name="l1736"><span class="linenum">1736</span></a>        is his adversary standing over him, enforcing his rights; the indictment,
<a name="l1737"><span class="linenum">1737</span></a>        which in their phraseology is termed the affidavit, is recited at
<a name="l1738"><span class="linenum">1738</span></a>        the time: and from this he must not deviate. He is a servant, and
<a name="l1739"><span class="linenum">1739</span></a>        is continually disputing about a fellow servant before his master,
<a name="l1740"><span class="linenum">1740</span></a>        who is seated, and has the cause in his hands; the trial is never
<a name="l1741"><span class="linenum">1741</span></a>        about some indifferent matter, but always concerns himself; and often
<a name="l1742"><span class="linenum">1742</span></a>        the race is for his life. The consequence has been, that he has become
<a name="l1743"><span class="linenum">1743</span></a>        keen and shrewd; he has learned how to flatter his master in word
<a name="l1744"><span class="linenum">1744</span></a>        and indulge him in deed; but his soul is small and unrighteous. His
<a name="l1745"><span class="linenum">1745</span></a>        condition, which has been that of a slave from his youth upwards,
<a name="l1746"><span class="linenum">1746</span></a>        has deprived him of growth and uprightness and independence; dangers
<a name="l1747"><span class="linenum">1747</span></a>        and fears, which were too much for his truth and honesty, came upon
<a name="l1748"><span class="linenum">1748</span></a>        him in early years, when the tenderness of youth was unequal to them,
<a name="l1749"><span class="linenum">1749</span></a>        and he has been driven into crooked ways; from the first he has practised
<a name="l1750"><span class="linenum">1750</span></a>        deception and retaliation, and has become stunted and warped. And
<a name="l1751"><span class="linenum">1751</span></a>        so he has passed out of youth into manhood, having no soundness in
<a name="l1752"><span class="linenum">1752</span></a>        him; and is now, as he thinks, a master in wisdom. Such is the lawyer,
<a name="l1753"><span class="linenum">1753</span></a>        Theodorus. Will you have the companion picture of the philosopher,
<a name="l1754"><span class="linenum">1754</span></a>        who is of our brotherhood; or shall we return to the argument? Do
<a name="l1755"><span class="linenum">1755</span></a>        not let us abuse the freedom of digression which we claim.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1756"><span class="linenum">1756</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Nay, Socrates, not until we have finished what we are about;
<a name="l1757"><span class="linenum">1757</span></a>        for you truly said that we belong to a brotherhood which is free,
<a name="l1758"><span class="linenum">1758</span></a>        and are not the servants of the argument; but the argument is our
<a name="l1759"><span class="linenum">1759</span></a>        servant, and must wait our leisure. Who is our judge? Or where is
<a name="l1760"><span class="linenum">1760</span></a>        the spectator having any right to censure or control us, as he might
<a name="l1761"><span class="linenum">1761</span></a>        the poets? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1762"><span class="linenum">1762</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then, as this is your wish, I will describe the leaders; for
<a name="l1763"><span class="linenum">1763</span></a>        there is no use in talking about the inferior sort. In the first place,
<a name="l1764"><span class="linenum">1764</span></a>        the lords of philosophy have never, from their youth upwards, known
<a name="l1765"><span class="linenum">1765</span></a>        their way to the Agora, or the dicastery, or the council, or any other
<a name="l1766"><span class="linenum">1766</span></a>        political assembly; they neither see nor hear the laws or decrees,
<a name="l1767"><span class="linenum">1767</span></a>        as they are called, of the state written or recited; the eagerness
<a name="l1768"><span class="linenum">1768</span></a>        of political societies in the attainment of office-clubs, and banquets,
<a name="l1769"><span class="linenum">1769</span></a>        and revels, and singing-maidens,-do not enter even into their dreams.
<a name="l1770"><span class="linenum">1770</span></a>        Whether any event has turned out well or ill in the city, what disgrace
<a name="l1771"><span class="linenum">1771</span></a>        may have descended to any one from his ancestors, male or female,
<a name="l1772"><span class="linenum">1772</span></a>        are matters of which the philosopher no more knows than he can tell,
<a name="l1773"><span class="linenum">1773</span></a>        as they say, how many pints are contained in the ocean. Neither is
<a name="l1774"><span class="linenum">1774</span></a>        he conscious of his ignorance. For he does not hold aloof in order;
<a name="l1775"><span class="linenum">1775</span></a>        that he may gain a reputation; but the truth is, that the outer form
<a name="l1776"><span class="linenum">1776</span></a>        of him only is in the city: his mind, disdaining the littlenesses
<a name="l1777"><span class="linenum">1777</span></a>        and nothingnesses of human things, is &amp;quot;flying all abroad&amp;quot; as Pindar
<a name="l1778"><span class="linenum">1778</span></a>        says, measuring earth and heaven and the things which are under and
<a name="l1779"><span class="linenum">1779</span></a>        on the earth and above the heaven, interrogating the whole nature
<a name="l1780"><span class="linenum">1780</span></a>        of each and all in their entirety, but not condescending to anything
<a name="l1781"><span class="linenum">1781</span></a>        which is within reach. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1782"><span class="linenum">1782</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; What do you mean, Socrates? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1783"><span class="linenum">1783</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; I will illustrate my meaning, Theodorus, by the jest which the
<a name="l1784"><span class="linenum">1784</span></a>        clever witty Thracian handmaid is said to have made about Thales,
<a name="l1785"><span class="linenum">1785</span></a>        when he fell into a well as he was looking up at the stars. She said,
<a name="l1786"><span class="linenum">1786</span></a>        that he was so eager to know what was going on in heaven, that he
<a name="l1787"><span class="linenum">1787</span></a>        could not see what was before his feet. This is a jest which is equally
<a name="l1788"><span class="linenum">1788</span></a>        applicable to all philosophers. For the philosopher is wholly unacquainted
<a name="l1789"><span class="linenum">1789</span></a>        with his next-door neighbour; he is ignorant, not only of what he
<a name="l1790"><span class="linenum">1790</span></a>        is doing, but he hardly knows whether he is a man or an animal; he
<a name="l1791"><span class="linenum">1791</span></a>        is searching into the essence of man, and busy in enquiring what belongs
<a name="l1792"><span class="linenum">1792</span></a>        to such a nature to do or suffer different from any other;-I think
<a name="l1793"><span class="linenum">1793</span></a>        that you understand me, Theodorus? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1794"><span class="linenum">1794</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; I do, and what you say is true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1795"><span class="linenum">1795</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And thus, my friend, on every occasion, private as well as public,
<a name="l1796"><span class="linenum">1796</span></a>        as I said at first, when he appears in a law-court, or in any place
<a name="l1797"><span class="linenum">1797</span></a>        in which he has to speak of things which are at his feet and before
<a name="l1798"><span class="linenum">1798</span></a>        his eyes, he is the jest, not only of Thracian handmaids but of the
<a name="l1799"><span class="linenum">1799</span></a>        general herd, tumbling into wells and every sort of disaster through
<a name="l1800"><span class="linenum">1800</span></a>        his inexperience. His awkwardness is fearful, and gives the impression
<a name="l1801"><span class="linenum">1801</span></a>        of imbecility. When he is reviled, he has nothing personal to say
<a name="l1802"><span class="linenum">1802</span></a>        in answer to the civilities of his adversaries, for he knows no scandals
<a name="l1803"><span class="linenum">1803</span></a>        of any one, and they do not interest him; and therefore he is laughed
<a name="l1804"><span class="linenum">1804</span></a>        at for his sheepishness; and when others are being praised and glorified,
<a name="l1805"><span class="linenum">1805</span></a>        in the simplicity of his heart he cannot help going into fits of laughter,
<a name="l1806"><span class="linenum">1806</span></a>        so that he seems to be a downright idiot. When he hears a tyrant or
<a name="l1807"><span class="linenum">1807</span></a>        king eulogized, he fancies that he is listening to the praises of
<a name="l1808"><span class="linenum">1808</span></a>        some keeper of cattle-a swineherd, or shepherd, or perhaps a cowherd,
<a name="l1809"><span class="linenum">1809</span></a>        who is congratulated on the quantity of milk which he squeezes from
<a name="l1810"><span class="linenum">1810</span></a>        them; and he remarks that the creature whom they tend, and out of
<a name="l1811"><span class="linenum">1811</span></a>        whom they squeeze the wealth, is of a less traitable and more insidious
<a name="l1812"><span class="linenum">1812</span></a>        nature. Then, again, he observes that the great man is of necessity
<a name="l1813"><span class="linenum">1813</span></a>        as ill-mannered and uneducated as any shepherd-for he has no leisure,
<a name="l1814"><span class="linenum">1814</span></a>        and he is surrounded by a wall, which is his mountain-pen. Hearing
<a name="l1815"><span class="linenum">1815</span></a>        of enormous landed proprietors of ten thousand acres and more, our
<a name="l1816"><span class="linenum">1816</span></a>        philosopher deems this to be a trifle, because he has been accustomed
<a name="l1817"><span class="linenum">1817</span></a>        to think of the whole earth; and when they sing the, praises of family,
<a name="l1818"><span class="linenum">1818</span></a>        and say that someone is a gentleman because he can show seven generations
<a name="l1819"><span class="linenum">1819</span></a>        of wealthy ancestors, he thinks that their sentiments only betray
<a name="l1820"><span class="linenum">1820</span></a>        a dull and narrow vision in those who utter them, and who are not
<a name="l1821"><span class="linenum">1821</span></a>        educated enough to look at the whole, nor to consider that every man
<a name="l1822"><span class="linenum">1822</span></a>        has had thousands and ten thousands of progenitors, and among them
<a name="l1823"><span class="linenum">1823</span></a>        have been rich and poor, kings and slaves, Hellenes and barbarians,
<a name="l1824"><span class="linenum">1824</span></a>        innumerable. And when people pride themselves on having a pedigree
<a name="l1825"><span class="linenum">1825</span></a>        of twenty-five ancestors, which goes back to Heracles, the son of
<a name="l1826"><span class="linenum">1826</span></a>        Amphitryon, he cannot understand their poverty of ideas. Why are they
<a name="l1827"><span class="linenum">1827</span></a>        unable to calculate that Amphitryon had a twenty-fifth ancestor, who
<a name="l1828"><span class="linenum">1828</span></a>        might have been anybody, and was such as fortune made him and he had
<a name="l1829"><span class="linenum">1829</span></a>        a fiftieth, and so on? He amuses himself with the notion that they
<a name="l1830"><span class="linenum">1830</span></a>        cannot count, and thinks that a little arithmetic would have got rid
<a name="l1831"><span class="linenum">1831</span></a>        of their senseless vanity. Now, in all these cases our philosopher
<a name="l1832"><span class="linenum">1832</span></a>        is derided by the vulgar, partly because he is thought to despise
<a name="l1833"><span class="linenum">1833</span></a>        them, and also because he is ignorant of what is before him, and always
<a name="l1834"><span class="linenum">1834</span></a>        at a loss. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1835"><span class="linenum">1835</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; That is very true, Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1836"><span class="linenum">1836</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But, O my friend, when he draws the other into upper air, and
<a name="l1837"><span class="linenum">1837</span></a>        gets him out of his pleas and rejoinders into the contemplation of
<a name="l1838"><span class="linenum">1838</span></a>        justice and injustice in their own nature and in their difference
<a name="l1839"><span class="linenum">1839</span></a>        from one another and from all other things; or from the commonplaces
<a name="l1840"><span class="linenum">1840</span></a>        about the happiness of a king or of a rich man to the consideration
<a name="l1841"><span class="linenum">1841</span></a>        of government, and of human happiness and misery in general-what they
<a name="l1842"><span class="linenum">1842</span></a>        are, and how a man is to attain the one and avoid the other-when that
<a name="l1843"><span class="linenum">1843</span></a>        narrow, keen, little legal mind is called to account about all this,
<a name="l1844"><span class="linenum">1844</span></a>        he gives the philosopher his revenge; for dizzied by the height at
<a name="l1845"><span class="linenum">1845</span></a>        which he is hanging, whence he looks down into space, which is a strange
<a name="l1846"><span class="linenum">1846</span></a>        experience to him, he being dismayed, and lost, and stammering broken
<a name="l1847"><span class="linenum">1847</span></a>        words, is laughed at, not by Thracian handmaidens or any other uneducated
<a name="l1848"><span class="linenum">1848</span></a>        persons, for they have no eye for the situation, but by every man
<a name="l1849"><span class="linenum">1849</span></a>        who has not been brought up a slave. Such are the two characters,
<a name="l1850"><span class="linenum">1850</span></a>        Theodorus: the one of the freeman, who has becomes trained in liberty
<a name="l1851"><span class="linenum">1851</span></a>        and leisure, whom you call the philosopher-him we cannot blame because
<a name="l1852"><span class="linenum">1852</span></a>        he appears simple and of no account when he has to perform some menial
<a name="l1853"><span class="linenum">1853</span></a>        task, such as packing up bed-clothes, or flavouring a sauce or fawning
<a name="l1854"><span class="linenum">1854</span></a>        speech; the other character is that of the man who is able to do all
<a name="l1855"><span class="linenum">1855</span></a>        this kind of service smartly and neatly, but knows not how to wear
<a name="l1856"><span class="linenum">1856</span></a>        his cloak like a gentleman; still less with the music of discourse
<a name="l1857"><span class="linenum">1857</span></a>        can he hymn the true life aright which is lived by immortals or men
<a name="l1858"><span class="linenum">1858</span></a>        blessed of heaven. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1859"><span class="linenum">1859</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; If you could only persuade everybody, Socrates, as you do me,
<a name="l1860"><span class="linenum">1860</span></a>        of the truth of your words, there would be more peace and fewer evils
<a name="l1861"><span class="linenum">1861</span></a>        among men. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1862"><span class="linenum">1862</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Evils, Theodorus, can never pass away; for there must always
<a name="l1863"><span class="linenum">1863</span></a>        remain something which is antagonistic to good. Having no place among
<a name="l1864"><span class="linenum">1864</span></a>        the gods in heaven, of necessity they hover around the mortal nature,
<a name="l1865"><span class="linenum">1865</span></a>        and this earthly sphere. Wherefore we ought to fly away from earth
<a name="l1866"><span class="linenum">1866</span></a>        to heaven as quickly as we can; and to fly away is to become like
<a name="l1867"><span class="linenum">1867</span></a>        God, as far as this is possible; and to become like him, is to become
<a name="l1868"><span class="linenum">1868</span></a>        holy, just, and wise. But, O my friend, you cannot easily convince
<a name="l1869"><span class="linenum">1869</span></a>        mankind that they should pursue virtue or avoid vice, not merely in
<a name="l1870"><span class="linenum">1870</span></a>        order that a man may seem to be good, which is the reason given by
<a name="l1871"><span class="linenum">1871</span></a>        the world, and in my judgment is only a repetition of an old wives
<a name="l1872"><span class="linenum">1872</span></a>        fable. Whereas, the truth is that God is never in any way unrighteous-he
<a name="l1873"><span class="linenum">1873</span></a>        is perfect righteousness; and he of us who is the most righteous is
<a name="l1874"><span class="linenum">1874</span></a>        most like him. Herein is seen the true cleverness of a man, and also
<a name="l1875"><span class="linenum">1875</span></a>        his nothingness and want of manhood. For to know this is true wisdom
<a name="l1876"><span class="linenum">1876</span></a>        and virtue, and ignorance of this is manifest folly and vice. All
<a name="l1877"><span class="linenum">1877</span></a>        other kinds of wisdom or cleverness, which seem only, such as the
<a name="l1878"><span class="linenum">1878</span></a>        wisdom of politicians, or the wisdom of the arts, are coarse and vulgar.
<a name="l1879"><span class="linenum">1879</span></a>        The unrighteous man, or the sayer and doer of unholy things, had far
<a name="l1880"><span class="linenum">1880</span></a>        better not be encouraged in the illusion that his roguery is clever;
<a name="l1881"><span class="linenum">1881</span></a>        for men glory in their shame -they fancy that they hear others saying
<a name="l1882"><span class="linenum">1882</span></a>        of them, &amp;quot;These are not mere good-for nothing persons, mere burdens
<a name="l1883"><span class="linenum">1883</span></a>        of the earth, but such as men should be who mean to dwell safely in
<a name="l1884"><span class="linenum">1884</span></a>        a state.&amp;quot; Let us tell them that they are all the more truly what they
<a name="l1885"><span class="linenum">1885</span></a>        do not think they are because they do not know it; for they do not
<a name="l1886"><span class="linenum">1886</span></a>        know the penalty of injustice, which above all things they ought to
<a name="l1887"><span class="linenum">1887</span></a>        know-not stripes and death, as they suppose, which evil-doers often
<a name="l1888"><span class="linenum">1888</span></a>        escape, but a penalty which cannot be escaped. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1889"><span class="linenum">1889</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; What is that? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1890"><span class="linenum">1890</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; There are two patterns eternally set before them; the one blessed
<a name="l1891"><span class="linenum">1891</span></a>        and divine, the other godless and wretched: but they do not see them,
<a name="l1892"><span class="linenum">1892</span></a>        or perceive that in their utter folly and infatuation they are growing
<a name="l1893"><span class="linenum">1893</span></a>        like the one and unlike the other, by reason of their evil deeds;
<a name="l1894"><span class="linenum">1894</span></a>        and the penalty is, that they lead a life answering to the pattern
<a name="l1895"><span class="linenum">1895</span></a>        which they are growing like. And if we tell them, that unless they
<a name="l1896"><span class="linenum">1896</span></a>        depart from their cunning, the place of innocence will not receive
<a name="l1897"><span class="linenum">1897</span></a>        them after death; and that here on earth, they will live ever in the
<a name="l1898"><span class="linenum">1898</span></a>        likeness of their own evil selves, and with evil friends-when they
<a name="l1899"><span class="linenum">1899</span></a>        hear this they in their superior cunning will seem to be listening
<a name="l1900"><span class="linenum">1900</span></a>        to the talk of idiots. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1901"><span class="linenum">1901</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true, Socrates. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1902"><span class="linenum">1902</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Too true, my friend, as I well know; there is, however, one peculiarity
<a name="l1903"><span class="linenum">1903</span></a>        in their case: when they begin to reason in private about their dislike
<a name="l1904"><span class="linenum">1904</span></a>        of philosophy, if they have the courage to hear the argument out and
<a name="l1905"><span class="linenum">1905</span></a>        do not run away, they grow at last strangely discontented with themselves;
<a name="l1906"><span class="linenum">1906</span></a>        their rhetoric fades away, and they become helpless as children. These
<a name="l1907"><span class="linenum">1907</span></a>        however are digressions from which we must now desist, or they will
<a name="l1908"><span class="linenum">1908</span></a>        overflow, and drown the original argument; to which, if you please,
<a name="l1909"><span class="linenum">1909</span></a>        we will now return. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1910"><span class="linenum">1910</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; For my part, Socrates, I would rather have the digressions,
<a name="l1911"><span class="linenum">1911</span></a>        for at my age I find them easier to follow; but if you wish, let us
<a name="l1912"><span class="linenum">1912</span></a>        go back to the argument. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1913"><span class="linenum">1913</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Had we not reached the point at which the partisans of the perpetual
<a name="l1914"><span class="linenum">1914</span></a>        flux, who say that things are as they seem to each one, were confidently
<a name="l1915"><span class="linenum">1915</span></a>        maintaining that the ordinances which the state commanded 2nd thought
<a name="l1916"><span class="linenum">1916</span></a>        just, were just to the state which imposed them, while they were in
<a name="l1917"><span class="linenum">1917</span></a>        force; this was especially asserted of justice; but as to the good,
<a name="l1918"><span class="linenum">1918</span></a>        no one had any longer the hardihood to contend of any ordinances which
<a name="l1919"><span class="linenum">1919</span></a>        the state thought and enacted to be good that these, while they were
<a name="l1920"><span class="linenum">1920</span></a>        in force, were really good;-he who said so would be playing with the
<a name="l1921"><span class="linenum">1921</span></a>        name &amp;quot;good,&amp;quot; and would, not touch the real question-it would be a
<a name="l1922"><span class="linenum">1922</span></a>        mockery, would it not? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1923"><span class="linenum">1923</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly it would. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1924"><span class="linenum">1924</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; He ought not to speak of the name, but of the thing which is
<a name="l1925"><span class="linenum">1925</span></a>        contemplated under the name. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1926"><span class="linenum">1926</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Right. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1927"><span class="linenum">1927</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Whatever be the term used, the good or expedient is the aim of
<a name="l1928"><span class="linenum">1928</span></a>        legislation, and as far as she has an opinion, the state imposes all
<a name="l1929"><span class="linenum">1929</span></a>        laws with a view to the greatest expediency; can legislation have
<a name="l1930"><span class="linenum">1930</span></a>        any other aim? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1931"><span class="linenum">1931</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1932"><span class="linenum">1932</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But is the aim attained always? do not mistakes often happen?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1933"><span class="linenum">1933</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, I think that there are mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1934"><span class="linenum">1934</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; The possibility of error will be more distinctly recognized,
<a name="l1935"><span class="linenum">1935</span></a>        if we put the question in reference to the whole class under which
<a name="l1936"><span class="linenum">1936</span></a>        the good or expedient fall That whole class has to do with the future,
<a name="l1937"><span class="linenum">1937</span></a>        and laws are passed under the idea that they will be useful in after-time;
<a name="l1938"><span class="linenum">1938</span></a>        which, in other words, is the future. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1939"><span class="linenum">1939</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1940"><span class="linenum">1940</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Suppose now, that we ask Protagoras, or one of his disciples,
<a name="l1941"><span class="linenum">1941</span></a>        a question:-O, Protagoras, we will say to him, Man is, as you declare,
<a name="l1942"><span class="linenum">1942</span></a>        the measure of all things-white, heavy, light: of all such things
<a name="l1943"><span class="linenum">1943</span></a>        he is the judge; for he has the criterion of them in himself, and
<a name="l1944"><span class="linenum">1944</span></a>        when he thinks that things are such as he experiences them to be,
<a name="l1945"><span class="linenum">1945</span></a>        he thinks what is and is true to himself. Is it not so? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1946"><span class="linenum">1946</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1947"><span class="linenum">1947</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And do you extend your doctrine, Protagoras (as we shall further
<a name="l1948"><span class="linenum">1948</span></a>        say), to the future as well as to the present; and has he the criterion
<a name="l1949"><span class="linenum">1949</span></a>        not only of what in his opinion is but of what will be, and do things
<a name="l1950"><span class="linenum">1950</span></a>        always happen to him as he expected? For example, take the case of
<a name="l1951"><span class="linenum">1951</span></a>        heat:-When an ordinary man thinks that he is going to have a fever,
<a name="l1952"><span class="linenum">1952</span></a>        and that this kind of heat is coming on, and another person, who is
<a name="l1953"><span class="linenum">1953</span></a>        a physician, thinks the contrary, whose opinion is likely to prove
<a name="l1954"><span class="linenum">1954</span></a>        right? Or are they both right?-he will have a heat and fever in his
<a name="l1955"><span class="linenum">1955</span></a>        own judgment, and not have a fever in the physician's judgment?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1956"><span class="linenum">1956</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; How ludicrous! &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1957"><span class="linenum">1957</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And the vinegrower, if I am not mistaken, is a better judge of
<a name="l1958"><span class="linenum">1958</span></a>        the sweetness or dryness of the vintage which is not yet gathered
<a name="l1959"><span class="linenum">1959</span></a>        than the harp-player? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1960"><span class="linenum">1960</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1961"><span class="linenum">1961</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And in musical composition-the musician will know better than
<a name="l1962"><span class="linenum">1962</span></a>        the training master what the training master himself will hereafter
<a name="l1963"><span class="linenum">1963</span></a>        think harmonious or the reverse? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1964"><span class="linenum">1964</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Of course. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1965"><span class="linenum">1965</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And the cook will be a better judge than the guest, who is not
<a name="l1966"><span class="linenum">1966</span></a>        a cook, of the pleasure to be derived from the dinner which is in
<a name="l1967"><span class="linenum">1967</span></a>        preparation; for of present or past pleasure we are not as yet arguing;
<a name="l1968"><span class="linenum">1968</span></a>        but can we say that every one will be to himself the best judge of
<a name="l1969"><span class="linenum">1969</span></a>        the pleasure which will seem to be and will be to him in the future?-nay,
<a name="l1970"><span class="linenum">1970</span></a>        would not you, Protagoras, better guess which arguments in a court
<a name="l1971"><span class="linenum">1971</span></a>        would convince any one of us than the ordinary man? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1972"><span class="linenum">1972</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly, Socrates, he used to profess in the strongest manner
<a name="l1973"><span class="linenum">1973</span></a>        that he was the superior of all men in this respect. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1974"><span class="linenum">1974</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; To be sure, friend: who would have paid a large sum for the privilege
<a name="l1975"><span class="linenum">1975</span></a>        of talking to him, if he had really persuaded his visitors that neither
<a name="l1976"><span class="linenum">1976</span></a>        a prophet nor any other man was better able to judge what will be
<a name="l1977"><span class="linenum">1977</span></a>        and seem to be in the future than every one could for himself?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1978"><span class="linenum">1978</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Who indeed? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1979"><span class="linenum">1979</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And legislation and expediency are all concerned with the future;
<a name="l1980"><span class="linenum">1980</span></a>        and every one will admit that states, in passing laws, must often
<a name="l1981"><span class="linenum">1981</span></a>        fail of their highest interests? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1982"><span class="linenum">1982</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Quite true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1983"><span class="linenum">1983</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then we may fairly argue against your master, that he must admit
<a name="l1984"><span class="linenum">1984</span></a>        one man to be wiser than another, and that the wiser is a measure:
<a name="l1985"><span class="linenum">1985</span></a>        but I, who know nothing, am not at all obliged to accept the honour
<a name="l1986"><span class="linenum">1986</span></a>        which the advocate of Protagoras was just now forcing upon me, whether
<a name="l1987"><span class="linenum">1987</span></a>        I would or not, of being a measure of anything. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1988"><span class="linenum">1988</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; That is the best refutation of him, Socrates; although he is
<a name="l1989"><span class="linenum">1989</span></a>        also caught when he ascribes truth to the opinions of others, who
<a name="l1990"><span class="linenum">1990</span></a>        give the lie direct to his own opinion. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l1991"><span class="linenum">1991</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; There are many ways, Theodorus, in which the doctrine that every
<a name="l1992"><span class="linenum">1992</span></a>        opinion of: every man is true may be refuted; but there is more difficulty,
<a name="l1993"><span class="linenum">1993</span></a>        in proving that states of feeling, which are present to a man, and
<a name="l1994"><span class="linenum">1994</span></a>        out of which arise sensations and opinions in accordance with them,
<a name="l1995"><span class="linenum">1995</span></a>        are also untrue. And very likely I have been talking nonsense about
<a name="l1996"><span class="linenum">1996</span></a>        them; for they may be unassailable, and those who say that there is
<a name="l1997"><span class="linenum">1997</span></a>        clear evidence of them, and that they are matters of knowledge, may
<a name="l1998"><span class="linenum">1998</span></a>        probably be right; in which case our friend Theaetetus was not so
<a name="l1999"><span class="linenum">1999</span></a>        far from the mark when he identified perception and knowledge. And
<a name="l2000"><span class="linenum">2000</span></a>        therefore let us draw nearer, as the advocate of Protagoras desires;
<a name="l2001"><span class="linenum">2001</span></a>        and the truth of the universal flux a ring: is the theory sound or
<a name="l2002"><span class="linenum">2002</span></a>        not? at any rate, no small war is raging about it, and there are combination
<a name="l2003"><span class="linenum">2003</span></a>        not a few. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2004"><span class="linenum">2004</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; No small, war, indeed, for in most the sect makes rapid strides,
<a name="l2005"><span class="linenum">2005</span></a>        the disciples of Heracleitus are most energetic. upholders of the
<a name="l2006"><span class="linenum">2006</span></a>        doctrine. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2007"><span class="linenum">2007</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then we are the more bound, my dear Theodorus, to examine the
<a name="l2008"><span class="linenum">2008</span></a>        question from the foundation as it is set forth by themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2009"><span class="linenum">2009</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly we are. About these speculations of Heracleitus,
<a name="l2010"><span class="linenum">2010</span></a>        which, as you say, are as old as Homer, or even older still, the Ephesians
<a name="l2011"><span class="linenum">2011</span></a>        themselves, who profess to know them, are downright mad, and you cannot
<a name="l2012"><span class="linenum">2012</span></a>        talk with them on the subject. For, in accordance with their text-books,
<a name="l2013"><span class="linenum">2013</span></a>        they are always in motion; but as for dwelling upon an argument or
<a name="l2014"><span class="linenum">2014</span></a>        a question, and quietly asking and answering in turn, they can no
<a name="l2015"><span class="linenum">2015</span></a>        more do so than they can fly; or rather, the determination of these
<a name="l2016"><span class="linenum">2016</span></a>        fellows not to have a particle of rest in them is more than the utmost
<a name="l2017"><span class="linenum">2017</span></a>        powers of negation can express. If you ask any of them a question,
<a name="l2018"><span class="linenum">2018</span></a>        he will produce, as from a quiver, sayings brief and dark, and shoot
<a name="l2019"><span class="linenum">2019</span></a>        them at you; and if you inquire the reason of what he has said, you
<a name="l2020"><span class="linenum">2020</span></a>        will be hit by some other newfangled word, and will make no way with
<a name="l2021"><span class="linenum">2021</span></a>        any of them, nor they with one another; their great care is, not to
<a name="l2022"><span class="linenum">2022</span></a>        allow of any settled principle either in their arguments or in their
<a name="l2023"><span class="linenum">2023</span></a>        minds, conceiving, as I imagine, that any such principle would be
<a name="l2024"><span class="linenum">2024</span></a>        stationary; for they are at war with the stationary, and do what they
<a name="l2025"><span class="linenum">2025</span></a>        can to drive it out everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2026"><span class="linenum">2026</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; I suppose, Theodorus, that you have only seen them when they
<a name="l2027"><span class="linenum">2027</span></a>        were fighting, and have never stayed with them in time of peace, for
<a name="l2028"><span class="linenum">2028</span></a>        they are no friends of yours; and their peace doctrines are only communicated
<a name="l2029"><span class="linenum">2029</span></a>        by them at leisure, as I imagine, to those disciples of theirs whom
<a name="l2030"><span class="linenum">2030</span></a>        they want to make like themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2031"><span class="linenum">2031</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Disciples! my good sir, they have none; men of their sort are
<a name="l2032"><span class="linenum">2032</span></a>        not one another's disciples, but they grow up at their own sweet will,
<a name="l2033"><span class="linenum">2033</span></a>        and get their inspiration anywhere, each of them saying of his neighbour
<a name="l2034"><span class="linenum">2034</span></a>        that he knows nothing. Fro these men, then, as I was going to remark,
<a name="l2035"><span class="linenum">2035</span></a>        you will never get a reason, whether with their will or without their
<a name="l2036"><span class="linenum">2036</span></a>        will; we must take the question out of their hands, and make the analysis
<a name="l2037"><span class="linenum">2037</span></a>        ourselves, as if we were doing geometrical problem. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2038"><span class="linenum">2038</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Quite right too; but as touching the aforesaid problem, have
<a name="l2039"><span class="linenum">2039</span></a>        we not heard from the ancients, who concealed their wisdom from the
<a name="l2040"><span class="linenum">2040</span></a>        many in poetical figures, that Oceanus and Tethys, the origin of all
<a name="l2041"><span class="linenum">2041</span></a>        things, are streams, and that nothing is at rest? And now the moderns,
<a name="l2042"><span class="linenum">2042</span></a>        in their superior wisdom, have declared the same openly, that the
<a name="l2043"><span class="linenum">2043</span></a>        cobbler too may hear and learn of them, and no longer foolishly imagine
<a name="l2044"><span class="linenum">2044</span></a>        that some things are at rest and others in motion-having learned that
<a name="l2045"><span class="linenum">2045</span></a>        all is motion, he will duly honour his teachers. I had almost forgotten
<a name="l2046"><span class="linenum">2046</span></a>        the opposite doctrine, Theodorus, &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2047"><span class="linenum">2047</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;Alone Being remains unmoved, which is the name for the all. This is
<a name="l2048"><span class="linenum">2048</span></a>        the language of Parmenides, Melissus, and their followers, who stoutly
<a name="l2049"><span class="linenum">2049</span></a>        maintain that all being is one and self-contained, and has no place
<a name="l2050"><span class="linenum">2050</span></a>        which to move. What shall we do, friend, with all these people; for,
<a name="l2051"><span class="linenum">2051</span></a>        advancing step by step, we have imperceptibly got between the combatants,
<a name="l2052"><span class="linenum">2052</span></a>        and, unless we can protect our retreat, we shall pay the penalty of
<a name="l2053"><span class="linenum">2053</span></a>        our rashness-like the players in the palaestra who are caught upon
<a name="l2054"><span class="linenum">2054</span></a>        the line, and are dragged different ways by the two parties. Therefore
<a name="l2055"><span class="linenum">2055</span></a>        I think that we had better begin by considering those whom we first
<a name="l2056"><span class="linenum">2056</span></a>        accosted, &amp;quot;the river-gods,&amp;quot; and, if we find any truth in them, we
<a name="l2057"><span class="linenum">2057</span></a>        will help them to pull us over, and try to get away from the others.
<a name="l2058"><span class="linenum">2058</span></a>        But if the partisans of &amp;quot;the whole&amp;quot; appear to speak more truly, we
<a name="l2059"><span class="linenum">2059</span></a>        will fly off from the party which would move the immovable, to them.
<a name="l2060"><span class="linenum">2060</span></a>        And if I find that neither of them have anything reasonable to say,
<a name="l2061"><span class="linenum">2061</span></a>        we shall be in a ridiculous position, having so great a conceit of
<a name="l2062"><span class="linenum">2062</span></a>        our own poor opinion and rejecting that of ancient and famous men.
<a name="l2063"><span class="linenum">2063</span></a>        O Theodorus, do you think that there is any use in proceeding when
<a name="l2064"><span class="linenum">2064</span></a>        the danger is so great? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2065"><span class="linenum">2065</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Nay, Socrates, not to examine thoroughly what the two parties
<a name="l2066"><span class="linenum">2066</span></a>        have to say would be quite intolerable. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2067"><span class="linenum">2067</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then examine we must, since you, who were so reluctant. to begin,
<a name="l2068"><span class="linenum">2068</span></a>        are so eager to proceed. The nature of motion appears to be the question
<a name="l2069"><span class="linenum">2069</span></a>        with which we begin. What do they mean when they say that all things
<a name="l2070"><span class="linenum">2070</span></a>        are in motion? Is there only one kind of motion, or, as I rather incline
<a name="l2071"><span class="linenum">2071</span></a>        to think, two? should like to have your opinion upon this point in
<a name="l2072"><span class="linenum">2072</span></a>        addition to my own, that I may err, if I must err, in your company;
<a name="l2073"><span class="linenum">2073</span></a>        tell me, then, when a thing changes from one place to another, or
<a name="l2074"><span class="linenum">2074</span></a>        goes round in the same place, is not that what is called motion?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2075"><span class="linenum">2075</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2076"><span class="linenum">2076</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Here then we have one kind of motion. But when a thing, remaining
<a name="l2077"><span class="linenum">2077</span></a>        on the same spot, grows old, or becomes black from being white, or
<a name="l2078"><span class="linenum">2078</span></a>        hard from being soft, or undergoes any other change, may not this
<a name="l2079"><span class="linenum">2079</span></a>        be properly called motion of another kind? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2080"><span class="linenum">2080</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; I think so. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2081"><span class="linenum">2081</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Say rather that it must be so. Of motion then there are these
<a name="l2082"><span class="linenum">2082</span></a>        two kinds, &amp;quot;change,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;motion in place.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2083"><span class="linenum">2083</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; You are right. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2084"><span class="linenum">2084</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And now, having made this distinction, let us address ourselves
<a name="l2085"><span class="linenum">2085</span></a>        to those who say that all is motion, and ask them whether all things
<a name="l2086"><span class="linenum">2086</span></a>        according to them have the two kinds of motion, and are changed as
<a name="l2087"><span class="linenum">2087</span></a>        well as move in place, or is one thing moved in both ways, and another
<a name="l2088"><span class="linenum">2088</span></a>        in one only? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2089"><span class="linenum">2089</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Indeed, I do not know what to answer; but I think they would
<a name="l2090"><span class="linenum">2090</span></a>        say that all things are moved in both ways. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2091"><span class="linenum">2091</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, comrade; for, if not, they would have to say that the same
<a name="l2092"><span class="linenum">2092</span></a>        things are in motion and at rest, and there would be no more truth
<a name="l2093"><span class="linenum">2093</span></a>        in saying that all things are in motion, than that all things are
<a name="l2094"><span class="linenum">2094</span></a>        at rest. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2095"><span class="linenum">2095</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; To be sure. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2096"><span class="linenum">2096</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And if they are to be in motion, and nothing is to be devoid
<a name="l2097"><span class="linenum">2097</span></a>        of motion, all things must always have every sort of motion?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2098"><span class="linenum">2098</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Most true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2099"><span class="linenum">2099</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Consider a further point: did we not understand them to explain
<a name="l2100"><span class="linenum">2100</span></a>        the generation of heat, whiteness, or anything else, in some such
<a name="l2101"><span class="linenum">2101</span></a>        manner as the following:-were they not saying that each of them is
<a name="l2102"><span class="linenum">2102</span></a>        moving between the agent and the patient, together with a perception,
<a name="l2103"><span class="linenum">2103</span></a>        and that the patient ceases to be a perceiving power and becomes a
<a name="l2104"><span class="linenum">2104</span></a>        percipient, and the agent a quale instead of a quality? I suspect
<a name="l2105"><span class="linenum">2105</span></a>        that quality may appear a strange and uncouth term to you, and that
<a name="l2106"><span class="linenum">2106</span></a>        you do not understand the abstract expression. Then I will take concrete
<a name="l2107"><span class="linenum">2107</span></a>        instances: I mean to say that the producing power or agent becomes
<a name="l2108"><span class="linenum">2108</span></a>        neither heat nor whiteness but hot and white, and the like of other
<a name="l2109"><span class="linenum">2109</span></a>        things. For I must repeat what I said before, that neither the agent
<a name="l2110"><span class="linenum">2110</span></a>        nor patient have any absolute existence, but when they come together
<a name="l2111"><span class="linenum">2111</span></a>        and generate sensations and their objects, the one becomes a thing
<a name="l2112"><span class="linenum">2112</span></a>        a certain quality, and the other a percipient. You remember?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2113"><span class="linenum">2113</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Of course. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2114"><span class="linenum">2114</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; We may leave the details of their theory unexamined, but we must
<a name="l2115"><span class="linenum">2115</span></a>        not forget to ask them the only question with which we are concerned:
<a name="l2116"><span class="linenum">2116</span></a>        Are all things in motion and flux? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2117"><span class="linenum">2117</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, they will reply. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2118"><span class="linenum">2118</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And they are moved in both those ways which we distinguished,
<a name="l2119"><span class="linenum">2119</span></a>        that is to Way, they move in place and are also changed?&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2120"><span class="linenum">2120</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Of course, if the motion is to be perfect. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2121"><span class="linenum">2121</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; If they only moved in place and were not changed, we should be
<a name="l2122"><span class="linenum">2122</span></a>        able to say what is the nature of the things which are in motion and
<a name="l2123"><span class="linenum">2123</span></a>        flux. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2124"><span class="linenum">2124</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Exactly. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2125"><span class="linenum">2125</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; But now, since not even white continues to flow white, and whiteness
<a name="l2126"><span class="linenum">2126</span></a>        itself is a flux or change which is passing into another colour, and
<a name="l2127"><span class="linenum">2127</span></a>        is never to be caught standing still, can the name of any colour be
<a name="l2128"><span class="linenum">2128</span></a>        rightly used at all? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2129"><span class="linenum">2129</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; How is that possible, Socrates, either in the case of this
<a name="l2130"><span class="linenum">2130</span></a>        or of any other quality-if while we are using the word the object
<a name="l2131"><span class="linenum">2131</span></a>        is escaping in the flux? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2132"><span class="linenum">2132</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And what would you say of perceptions, such as sight and hearing,
<a name="l2133"><span class="linenum">2133</span></a>        or any other kind of perception? Is there any stopping in the act
<a name="l2134"><span class="linenum">2134</span></a>        of seeing and hearing? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2135"><span class="linenum">2135</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly not, if all things are in motion. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2136"><span class="linenum">2136</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then we must not speak of seeing any more than of not-seeing,
<a name="l2137"><span class="linenum">2137</span></a>        nor of any other perception more than of any non-perception, if all
<a name="l2138"><span class="linenum">2138</span></a>        things partake of every kind of motion? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2139"><span class="linenum">2139</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Certainly not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2140"><span class="linenum">2140</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Yet perception is knowledge: so at least Theaetetus and I were
<a name="l2141"><span class="linenum">2141</span></a>        saying. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2142"><span class="linenum">2142</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Very true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2143"><span class="linenum">2143</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Then when we were asked what is knowledge, we no more answered
<a name="l2144"><span class="linenum">2144</span></a>        what is knowledge than what is not knowledge? &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2145"><span class="linenum">2145</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; I suppose not. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2146"><span class="linenum">2146</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Here, then, is a fine result: we corrected our first answer in
<a name="l2147"><span class="linenum">2147</span></a>        our eagerness to prove that nothing is at rest. But if nothing is
<a name="l2148"><span class="linenum">2148</span></a>        at rest, every answer upon whatever subject is equally right: you
<a name="l2149"><span class="linenum">2149</span></a>        may say that a thing is or is not thus; or, if you prefer, &amp;quot;becomes&amp;quot;
<a name="l2150"><span class="linenum">2150</span></a>        thus; and if we say &amp;quot;becomes,&amp;quot; we shall not then hamper them with
<a name="l2151"><span class="linenum">2151</span></a>        words expressive of rest. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2152"><span class="linenum">2152</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Quite true. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2153"><span class="linenum">2153</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, Theodorus, except in saying &amp;quot;thus&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;not thus.&amp;quot; But you
<a name="l2154"><span class="linenum">2154</span></a>        ought not to use the word &amp;quot;thus,&amp;quot; for there is no motion in &amp;quot;thus&amp;quot;
<a name="l2155"><span class="linenum">2155</span></a>        or in &amp;quot;not thus.&amp;quot; The maintainers of the doctrine have as yet no words
<a name="l2156"><span class="linenum">2156</span></a>        in which to express themselves, and must get a new language. I know
<a name="l2157"><span class="linenum">2157</span></a>        of no word that will suit them, except perhaps &amp;quot;no how,&amp;quot; which is
<a name="l2158"><span class="linenum">2158</span></a>        perfectly indefinite. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2159"><span class="linenum">2159</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, that is a manner of speaking in which they will be quite
<a name="l2160"><span class="linenum">2160</span></a>        at home. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2161"><span class="linenum">2161</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; And so, Theodorus, we have got rid of your friend without assenting
<a name="l2162"><span class="linenum">2162</span></a>        to his doctrine, that every man is the measure of all things-a wise
<a name="l2163"><span class="linenum">2163</span></a>        man only is a measure; neither can we allow that knowledge is perception,
<a name="l2164"><span class="linenum">2164</span></a>        certainly not on the hypothesis of a perpetual flux, unless perchance
<a name="l2165"><span class="linenum">2165</span></a>        our friend Theaetetus is able to convince us that it is.&lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2166"><span class="linenum">2166</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Very good, Socrates; and now that the argument about the doctrine
<a name="l2167"><span class="linenum">2167</span></a>        of Protagoras has been completed, I am absolved from answering; for
<a name="l2168"><span class="linenum">2168</span></a>        this was the agreement. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2169"><span class="linenum">2169</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Not, Theodorus, until you and Socrates have discussed the
<a name="l2170"><span class="linenum">2170</span></a>        doctrine of those who say that all things are at rest, as you were
<a name="l2171"><span class="linenum">2171</span></a>        proposing. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2172"><span class="linenum">2172</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; You, Theaetetus, who are a young rogue, must not instigate
<a name="l2173"><span class="linenum">2173</span></a>        your elders to a breach of faith, but should prepare to answer Socrates
<a name="l2174"><span class="linenum">2174</span></a>        in the remainder of the argument. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2175"><span class="linenum">2175</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theaetetus.&lt;/em&gt; Yes, if he wishes; but I would rather have heard about the
<a name="l2176"><span class="linenum">2176</span></a>        doctrine of rest. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2177"><span class="linenum">2177</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Theodorus.&lt;/em&gt; Invite Socrates to an argument-invite horsemen to the open
<a name="l2178"><span class="linenum">2178</span></a>        plain; do but ask him, and he will answer. &lt;/p&gt;
<a name="l2179"><span class="linenum">2179</span></a>      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Socrates.&lt;/em&gt; Nevertheless, Theodorus, I am afraid that I shall not.&lt;/p&gt;
