He is trying to decide whether or not to spend money on new technology that will reduce the level of a particular toxin in the wastewater that flows out the back of the factory and into a lake. The factory's emission levels are already within legal limits. However, Mark knows that environmental regulations for this particular toxin are lagging behind scientific evidence. In fact, a scientist from the university had been quoted in the newspaper recently, saying that if emission levels stayed at this level, the fish in the lakes and rivers in the area might soon have to be declared unsafe for human consumption. The company's environmental compliance budget is tight. Asking for this new technology to be installed would put Mark's department over-budget, which would mean laying off loyal long-term employees.&lt;/p&gt;

<a name="l34"><span class="linenum">  34</span></a>          &lt;p&gt;As chief legal officer in a well-respected company making lifesaving medical equipment, Shannon had been asked by his board of directors to look into rumors of price-fixing in the firm's overseas offices. His board had a very strong ethics policy, and was especially wary of price-fixing, bribery, kick-backs, and other unethical activities that can plague overseas operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several months of detailed interviews, Shannon satisfied himself that the rumors were groundless. As one of the overseas managers said, &quot;There's no issue here.&quot; But, he added, &quot;if you really want something to investigate, look into the Afghanistan contract.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the months, Shannon kept hearing about &quot;the Afghanistan contract.&quot; So when he had finished his report on the price-fixing rumors, he decided to satisfy his curiosity on the other matter. The contract, he discovered, had been ordinary in almost every respect: A major relief organization had contracted with his company to supply a million inexpensive medical kits for delivery into the war-torn regions of Afghanistan. Like most such contracts with charitable organizations, it contained hardly any profit for his firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he found strange, however, was the payment of an extraordinarily large commission to a Afghani distributor to deliver the kits deep into Afghanistan. Seeking out the executive in his own firm who had negotiated the contract, he had one question in mind: Was this a bribe?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes and no, said the executive. According to the Afghani distributor, the backs of the delivery trucks were loaded with the kits — and the glove compartments were stuffed with cash. That way, when the drivers were stopped at roadblocks set up by local war lords, they could pay whatever was demanded and continue their journey. In the past, he noted, drivers without cash had been taken from their trucks and shot. If the kits were to be delivered, this was a cost of doing business. To further complicate matters, several truck drivers were known to have stolen some of this cash themselves, but this too had been written off as part of the cost of getting medical kits to the people who needed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shannon felt sure that none of the money had flowed back to the executive, whose only motive was to get the kits delivered. And by this time, the deliveries had already been made. Yet Shannon still struggled with the question of whether he should draft a separate report to the board on this most unorthodox contract. On the one hand, it was clearly his duty to do so, but he was concerned about possibly causing great harm to the well-meaning executive who had negotiated it or embarrassment to the relief organization, which was aware of the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, he has already planted the bombs and they are scheduled to go off in a short time. It is possible that hundreds of people may die. The authorities cannot make him divulge the location of the bombs by conventional methods. He refuses to say anything and requests a lawyer to protect his fifth amendment right against self-incrimination. In exasperation, some high level official suggests torture. This would be illegal, of course, but the official thinks that it is nevertheless the right thing to do in this desperate situation.&lt;/p&gt;

George recognizes that there is little danger to himself if he jumps in to save the boy. Nevertheless, he chooses to ignore the boy's cries. The water is cold and he is afraid of catching a cold. He doesn't want to ruin his good suit either. &quot;Why should I inconvenience myself for this kid,&quot; George says to himself, and passes on. Lucy and her friend John are passing by at the same time. John immediately removes his shows and jacket and plunges into the water to save the boy. Lucy, who saw George glance at the boy then walk on, thinks that George should be arrested for leaving the drowning boy to die.&lt;/p&gt;

You have been asked to assign one team-member to an important cross-disciplinary committee advising on a new policy and service framework that will directly impact upon your team’s functioning well into the future. You know that successful membership of the committee is critical for the role and reputation of your team in the health service. You know of two people in your team who might be able to represent the team on the committee. Sarah has extensive experience working on similar committees, but she is somewhat over-committed at present. Trevor is a young, extremely competent recent immigrant from Iran who speaks impeccable English and has gained a good reputation for his clinical work, although he has never worked on a project like this. As clinical leader you have been in support of efforts to shift the culture of the health service to provide more opportunities for young professionals in leadership and strategic roles and you are keen to provide whatever opportunities you can for Trevor as he clearly has great potential. On this basis, you decide to assign the role to Trevor. Two months later, you hear through the grapevine that the chair of the committee, Harold, appears to be ignoring Trevor’s input and has been heard to comment that you should have appointed someone more experienced and ‘better suited to communicating effectively’ in the role. As far as you can tell, Trevor has some great ideas that might be helpful for the committee, and there is no obvious reason to remove him from the committee. On the other hand, you are worried that continuing on your current course might jeopardize your team’s opportunity to contribute to this important committee.&lt;/p&gt;
