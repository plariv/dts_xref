She is now seeking therapy after having a series of disorienting experiences that she describes in religious/spiritual terms. She is not personally uncomfortable with the experiences themselves, but others are, and this has interfered with her relationships by complicating communication with those closest to her and alienating people she knows less well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friends and family have expressed concern about her mental health, and she is concerned that if her boss learns about her experiences, she will lose her job. Denise has consulted with two prominent therapists. One views her recent experiences as evidence of an impending psychotic break and suggests aggressive treatment. The other views them as valid religious experiences and suggests an alternative approach, referring her to a variety of religious teachers and texts.&lt;/p&gt;

<a name="l13"><span class="linenum">  13</span></a>          &lt;p&gt;In the USA there has been ongoing debate concerning the theory of evolution and whether it should be taught in schools. Many religious scholars think that Darwin's theory of evolution is &amp;quot;just a theory&amp;quot; and therefore should not be considered better than other accounts of human origins, such as those offered in the Bible, Talmud, or Koran. They are likely to agree that the evolutionary account leaves humanity without dignity and moral purpose. On the other hand, most scientists think that Darwin's theory of evolution is the only account of human origins that should be taught, arguing that the scientific explanation is the only one that convincingly accounts for existing evidence. They are likely to agree that the evolutionary account undoes some of the irrational and dangerous beliefs perpetrated by religious traditions.&lt;/p&gt;

<a name="l20"><span class="linenum">  20</span></a>          &lt;p&gt;Several scientists have raised concerns about global warming, warning us that pollutants released into the air are causing rapid warming of the Earth, resulting in major environmental changes. They argue that this rapid warming of the planet will result in widespread devastation, and should be curtailed by dramatically reducing airborne pollutants. Other scientists argue that global warming due to pollution is likely to cause fluctuations in mean global temperatures, but that some of these changes will be beneficial, especially in the Northern hemisphere. They argue that, though it is desirable to reduce pollution in the long term (for quality-of-life reasons), the dramatic reduction of airborne pollutants advocated by the first group of scientists would be costly and ineffective, and not necessarily good for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

<a name="l27"><span class="linenum">  27</span></a>          &lt;p&gt;A certain cultural group has recently drawn the attention of the international media. This group, numbering into the hundreds of thousands, maintains the ways of their ancestors despite their growing exposure to modern influences. One tradition they maintain involves a system of social roles and expectations, which requires the ill treatment of the second daughter born into any family. Touted as the &lt;em&gt;second daughter syndrome&lt;/em&gt; by the Western media, this traditional practice can be deadly. It involves long-held beliefs about the meaning and role of second daughters, beliefs that have been codified in myths that claim a lower-status for the families possessing a second daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to counteract this mark of lower-status, a family (especially the father) must display disaffection towards their second daughter. This can take a number of forms. However, it most often takes the form of starvation. The repeated act of sending the visually malnourished second daughter into public is felt to lift the mark of lower-status the family received as a result of her birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second daughters are not educated and are not allowed to marry. They must care for the parents into old age if they survive—most second daughters don't live past the age of 25. Given the pervasiveness of the practice, some of the second daughters identify with their role. They often voluntarily starve themselves and very seldom complain or seek equal treatment. Suicide is common, often committed by the daughter to disburden the family; these suicides are declared as acts of love. However, deaths from malnutrition are the most common killer of second daughters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several human-rights agencies have initiated studies in order to prepare for and assess the validity and justification for possible interventions. One group of anthropologists traced the &lt;em&gt;second daughter syndrome&lt;/em&gt; to times during which food scarcity and over population made second daughters a much greater danger and burden then second sons, who could hunt. These anthropologists explained that the myths were constructed as justifications for the ritual extermination of second daughters carried out thousands of years ago. They maintain that the myths are illusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other anthropologists disagree with this theory. They maintain that the myths cannot be reduced to this function, that they reflect broader metaphysical and religious truth claims, and that to degrade these myths would call the whole of their cultural knowledge into question. They assert that the myths are more than mere illusion because they are pieces of a larger world-view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some psychologists who have interviewed the second daughters have found disturbingly high levels of depression, distorted and unhealthy forms of self-image, and very low levels of self-esteem. They found that the daughters often functioned as scapegoats in the family structures and were subject to many forms of psychological abuse. They maintained that it was simply a fact that these daughters are unhealthy and that the family structures are dysfunctional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other psychologists disagreed. They questioned applying Western categories to a non-western culture. They maintained that forms of psychological health are not cross-cultural, i.e., while self-esteem may be healthy in our culture it may be seen as arrogant and insulting in others. Moreover, these psychologist claim that psychological abuse, being dependent upon these categories, is also likewise relative.&lt;/p&gt;

<a name="l34"><span class="linenum">  34</span></a>          &lt;p&gt;As chief legal officer in a well-respected company making lifesaving medical equipment, Shannon had been asked by his board of directors to look into rumors of price-fixing in the firm's overseas offices. His board had a very strong ethics policy, and was especially wary of price-fixing, bribery, kick-backs, and other unethical activities that can plague overseas operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several months of detailed interviews, Shannon satisfied himself that the rumors were groundless. As one of the overseas managers said, &amp;quot;There's no issue here.&amp;quot; But, he added, &amp;quot;if you really want something to investigate, look into the Afghanistan contract.&amp;quot; Over the months, Shannon kept hearing about &amp;quot;the Afghanistan contract.&amp;quot; So, when he had finished his report on the price-fixing rumors, he decided to satisfy his curiosity on the other matter. The contract, he discovered, had been ordinary in almost every respect: A major relief organization had contracted with his company to supply a million inexpensive medical kits for delivery into the war-torn regions of Afghanistan. Like most such contracts with charitable organizations, it contained hardly any profit for his firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What he found strange, however, was the payment of an extraordinarily large commission to a Afghani distributor to deliver the kits deep into Afghanistan. Seeking out the executive in his own firm who had negotiated the contract, he had one question in mind: Was this a bribe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes and no, said the executive. According to the Afghani distributor, the backs of the delivery trucks were loaded with the kits — and the glove compartments were stuffed with cash. That way, when the drivers were stopped at roadblocks set up by local war lords, they could pay whatever was demanded and continue their journey. In the past, he noted, drivers without cash had been taken from their trucks and shot. If the kits were to be delivered, this was a cost of doing business. To further complicate matters, several truck drivers were known to have stolen some of this cash themselves, but this too had been written off as part of the cost of getting medical kits to the people who needed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shannon felt sure that none of the money had flowed back to the executive, whose only motive was to get the kits delivered. And by this time, the deliveries had already been made. Yet Shannon still struggled with the question of whether he should draft a separate report to the board on this most unorthodox contract. On the one hand, it was clearly his duty to do so, but he was concerned about possibly causing great harm to the well-meaning executive who had negotiated it or embarrassment to the relief organization, which was aware of the commission.&lt;/p&gt;

<a name="l41"><span class="linenum">  41</span></a>          &lt;p&gt;The current global economy is based on an investment-based economic model that requires relatively constant growth. Economists who favor this model point to evidence that the human condition, overall, has improved as a consequence of this system, which has generated heretofore unheard of wealth and distributed it more widely than any previous system. They express great concern that any interference with the current system could cause a total economic collapse resulting in unprecedented human suffering. However, a growing number of economists are convinced that economic growth inevitably will be accompanied by increasing environmental degradation, contributing in the long term to even greater human suffering. They favor economic models that promote a more equitable distribution of existing wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
