  <h1>HOW TO TAKE A LECTICAL<sup>®</sup> ASSESSMENT  </h1>
  <div class="box">
    Important note: What you get out of a Lectical assessment will depend on what you put into it. Give yourself the time and space to  provide a sample of your best thinking and writing. </div>

	<h3>THE MECHANICS</h3>
		<ol>
		  <li>Go to http://lectica.org . Click on &quot;log in&quot; in the menu at the top of the page. Complete the log in form with your username and password.</li>
			<li>If you have not already registered, please click on &quot;contact us&quot; in the menu at the top of the page. Let us know your name and the name of the person who directed you to take an assessment. We will respond within one business day. </li>
			<li>After logging in, you will arrive on the assessment selection page. To take an assessment, click on the assessment icon, then follow the link to begin. For example, to take the LDMA, click on the LDMA icon, then on “take the LDMA.”</li>
			<li>After beginning an assessment, you will arrive on the &quot;How to take a Lectical Assessment&quot; page. Read through the instructions. Remember, what you get out of a Lectical Assessment will depend on what you put into it. Give yourself the time and space to provide a sample of your best thinking and writing.</li>
			<li>Write your responses directly into the fields on each page. Unless you have been instructed otherwise, you do not have to complete this assessment in a single sitting. However, if you stop working on a page for more than 15 minutes at a time, you may lose the work you have done on that page if you have not saved it. If you must leave your computer, always click &quot;SAVE YOUR WORK&quot;. If you are using an older browser, it is a good idea to click &quot;SAVE YOUR WORK&quot; every 10-15 minutes.</li>
			<li>If you’re not able to complete your assessment in one sitting, or if you’d prefer to answer in stages, submit the last page you were working on and log out. You’ll be able to use your username and password to log in and continue the assessment. Never try to return to an assessment by using &quot;bookmarks&quot; or leaving the assessment page open. </li>
			<li>When you wish to resume the assessment, log in. Click on the assessment icon, then follow the link to continue. For example, to resume your LDMA, click on the LDMA icon and then on “continue your LDMA.&quot; Click through the completed pages until you reach the page you’d like to work on.</li>
			<li>When your assessment results have been released, you will receive an email with instructions for viewing your report.</li>
        </ol>

	<h3>HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS</h3>
		<p>When you take a lectical assessment, you will be asked a series of questions that require you to <span class="emphasis">explain</span> your thinking. You provide answers all of the time. An answer is a decision, a choice, or a fact. Most tests require factual answers. Lectical assessments are different. When you take a lectical assessment, you are required to <span class="emphasis">explain</span> your thinking. For example, here is a  reflective judgment dilemma like those we use in the LRJA:</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p><span class="italics">&quot;There have been frequent reports about the relationship between chemicals that are added to foods and the safety of these foods. Some studies indicate that such chemicals can cause cancer, making these foods unsafe to eat. Other studies, however, show that chemical additives are not harmful, and actually make the foods containing them safer to eat.&quot;</span></p>
			</blockquote>
		<p>This dilemma, if it was part of an LRJA, would be followed by a series of <span class="emphasis">probing</span> questions—questions that ask for <span class="emphasis">judgments and justifications</span>. One such question would be: </p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><span class="italics">&quot;How is it possible that experts can come to such different conclusions?&quot; </span></p>
			</blockquote>
		<p>This question does not have one correct answer. It’s like most real-life questions; there are many ways to think about it, so people disagree—even the experts. When you answer a question like this one on a lectical assessment, we can’t score your answer unless you show us your thinking. To provide an accurate score, we need you to show off your best thinking. Here is an example of a poorly explained response:</p>
			<blockquote>
			  <p><span class="italics">&quot;They disagree because they are all biased. Everyone is biased.&quot;</span></p>
			</blockquote>
      <p>This is what we call an <span class="emphasis">unscorable</span> response. Even though it is clear that this test taker believes bias is the reason experts disagree, the response doesn’t tell us enough to provide a score. We need to know <span class="emphasis">how</span> this person thinks about bias and how it works to create disagreement. Here is a well-explained response:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><span class="italics">&quot;They disagree because they are all biased. Everyone is biased. Even though experts like scientists use special methods to gather evidence and evaluate it, different scientists with different backgrounds will see things differently. This could be because they look at different evidence, do different kinds of experiments, or have different attitudes about risk. Sometimes an expert who is employed by a company that adds chemicals to food will prefer to look at evidence that shows chemicals to be safe. Even if he is trying to be fair, he will probably be biased.</span>&quot;</p>
			</blockquote>
		<p>It is not <span class="emphasis">what</span> this person says that makes this a scorable response, it is the amount and clarity of the explanation she provides. We can understand <span class="emphasis">how</span> she is thinking. Before you take a lectical assessment, consider how you would answer this question. What kind of explanation would you provide?</p>
 
 	<h3>HOW TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS</h3>
		<p>At DTS, we are constantly improving our assessments, incorporating what we have learned from test-takers and academic research. This means that Lectical assessments are never &ldquo;finished&rdquo;. Each time we make a change to an existing assessment, we run the risk of introducing a bug or two. You may find one of these, especially if you are taking a research assessment. If you have any problems with the site, please <a href="../contactus.php">contact us</a> immediately. We respond promptly.</p>
